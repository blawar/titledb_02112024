        "description": "Stranded on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \n\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\nOver 80 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment. Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\n\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\n\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces\u2014ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\n\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK\u2019s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\n\nRPG STATISTICS\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\n\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains \u201csleeping\u201d in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\n",

Players will get to meet mythological figures such as the Spirit Wardens, the Ox-head and Horse-face Guardians of the Beyond, and the Tudi Gong (Keeper of the Land).\n\nThe player takes on the role of Yun, a \"rewinder\" who has the ability to enter people's memories and influence their actions. By utilizing \"senses\" and swaying others' \"intentions\", he can change history. \n\nAt the request of the Spirit Wardens, Yun goes to a small village to investigate why a spirit couldn't be reincarnated. The once thriving village has been deserted and filled with resentful spirits, leaving one woman alone in the teahouse. Who's she waiting for? Where did all the other villagers go? What really happened seven years ago?",

Learn to manipulate the world's structure by pushing boxes into and out of each other. Wrap your head around what happens when a box contains itself, and learn to use infinity to your advantage. Explore many more mechanics and recursive twists as you delve deeper and deeper into the system. It's boxes all the way down.\n\nThe game has over 350 hand-crafted puzzles, which are designed to make you think, but also to guide you and showcase the beauty of the system. Each puzzle contains a new idea; there is no filler.\n\nA soothing, inquisitive soundtrack and sound design by Priscilla Snow reflects new mechanics as they are introduced.\n\nPatrick's Parabox won the Excellence in Design award in the Independent Games Festival 2020. The game was also an IndieCade 2019 festival selection and received the IndieCade Developers Choice award.",

Have you ever wondered who would win, King Arthur (aided by Merlin) or a sword-wielding Alice of Wonderland? How would Sinbad and his trusty porter fare against Medusa and the three harpies? The only way to find the truth is in battle with a quick game of Unmatched!\n\nIn Battle The Are No Equals!\n\nWhat is Unmatched?\nUnmatched: Digital Edition is a tactical game where each player commands their hero and sidekick(s), using a unique deck of cards, to defeat their opponent on the field of battle.\n\nThe rules are simple.

Medusa can damage you with just a glance.\n\nWhat makes Unmatched great?\nUnmatched is one of those easy-to-learn games with an incredible amount of depth. The tactical insight and knowledge of your hero and your opponents will determine the outcome of the fight. Games are quick \u2013 but play out very differently! Your decisions will determine your fate, and your skill (and just a bit of luck) will win the day.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n* Epic duels between the most unlikely opponents!\n* Huge tactical depth!\n* Stunning artwork by legendary artists!\n*Three levels of AI for solo play!\n* Near infinite replayability!\n* Easy to learn, hard to master!\n* In-game tutorial and rulebook!\n* Online multiplayer!\n* Synchronous and asynchronous game modes!\n* Official Unmatched rules consulted with the designers of the board game!\n* Multiple expansions to come - bringing new heroes and maps!\n* Unique experience of a board game with the convenience of a digital platform!",

But not that of the senile shepherd Lars, but of his countless other sheep. Because after such a long wait, Sven has built up pressure. A lot of pressure!\n\nDiscover over 25 ways to dance the horizontal tango, churn the butter and plant the parsnips. Not only Sven has needs after such a long time: The sheep are also just waiting eagerly to finally be seduced again. \n\nThe longer they have not been satisfied, the more frustrated they get. So Sven is doubly motivated to knead the dough and put the bread in the oven.\n\nBut beware of shepherd Lars and his attentive dog Wotan, because they both guard the flock with watchful eyes. If they catch Sven on his love odyssey, it's high time to scram. If they catch him, all the fun and games are over.\n\nFor the first time, it is possible to dance the no-pants-dance in real 3D. This not only helps to get a better overview of the animals waiting to be made happy, but also to love through the world more smoothly. Sven\u2019s movement has been improved as well as the AI of Wotan and Lars revised to make for exciting rounds and requiring a tactical approach for the most beautiful affair in the world.\n\nIn addition, for the first time in a part of the Sven series, it is possible to start an orgy with up to 4 players. No pants\u2019ll stay dry. Smash!\n\n\u2022 The first Sven game in real 3D, lovingly animated by hand\n\u2022 The best of both worlds: Be both the active and the passive part\n\u2022 3 different game modes: Singleplayer, Co-op, Versus\n\u2022 20 exciting and challenging levels\n\u2022 Over 25 ways to make the sheep world happy\n\u2022 Use crazy items, now also actively usable thanks to an inventory \n\u2022 Local multiplayer mode for up to 4 players\n\u2022 Compete with players from all over the world via the online high score list!\n",

This praised game series was born from the idea of avoiding combat and infiltrating enemy territory undetected, a complete reversal of common action gameplay resulting in the creation of a brand-new game genre: stealth action.\n\nPlease note that certain parts of the game have been modified from the original for better payability and adjusted difficulty levels, while maintaining the gameplay as it was back then.\n\nMetal Gear 2: Solid Snake\nThis is the second title in the METAL GEAR series that establishes the basic mechanics of the series, such as crouching to avoid detection, intentionally attracting enemies by banging on walls, enemies reacting to Snake's footsteps, a radar to detect enemy locations, actions and movements.\n\nIt also depicts the motivations behind BIG BOSS' actions, the fate of soldiers with no nation left to fight for, and a complex narrative that has become an iconic characteristic of the series.",

Test your skills and perseverance as you overcome the progressive disease that threatened Monet\u2019s eyesight and solve puzzles to help the painter complete some of his greatest masterpieces.\n\nAbout the Game:\nThe Master\u2019s Pupil is a puzzle adventure where you will travel across the iris of Claude Monet and help him complete his masterpieces.\n\nThroughout the game, you will encounter and overcome increasing challenges as Monet experiences loss, like the passing of his wife Camille, and struggles with the cataracts that threatened his art making. Consider color, space, and physics as you traverse the world of his eye - as one wrong color combination or move can end your journey.\n\nKey Features:\n- Hand Painted and expertly crafted - almost every part of this game has been painstakingly made using a real paintbrush in real life before being imported to the world. The results are unique visuals reminiscent of Monet\u2019s Impressionism that change and adapt over his lifetime.\n- A Biographical Adventure - experience a life\u2019s story in a way that has never been done before. No language or text describes the man or his actions, instead navigate intricate landscapes based on Monet\u2019s real paintings, and journey through a unique rich soundscape. All matched with an emotional and moving score by indie composer Steven W Schouten.\n- Calm and Relaxed - An artist doesn\u2019t rush but takes their time when completing their work. The Master\u2019s Pupil gives you time to consider each puzzle, with tests that will challenge your brain but not your reflexes.\n",

Each section and level is uniquely designed and not repetitive.\n- Super responsive controls for tight gameplay\n- Infinite lives and multiple checkpoints on every level\n- Hand-drawn pixel art graphics and animations including intro and outro cutscenes.\n- Modern lighting and effects to add style and feel\n- Time Attack for each level that rates you based on how fast you beat each level (for the speed-runners out there)\n- Beautiful Retro Synth-wave/electronic soundtrack",

But can Little Hero and his clandestine companions truly restore peace to their land? An adventure of mother and child\u2060\u2014and pooch\u2060\u2014begins...\n\nHow to Play:\nVarious monsters stand in the way, but Little Hero is much too young to handle them all himself. Support him in being victorious by first weakening the monsters with your summoning powers. Little Hero will gain Confidence to defeat more monsters and grow stronger. Help Little Hero increase his level and prepare for the final boss showdown!\n\nSystem:\n- Partnership Chance\nThis event increases your chances of landing a contract with a defeated boss, with any remaining HP increasing your chance of success. Here's your opportunity to twist boss monsters' arms into signing away!\n\n- Contract System\nWhen luck is on your side, you'll get a chance to offer a contract to the monsters that Little Hero defeats at the end of the stage. Monsters who sign can be set in the Grimoire, allowing you to summon them. You'll be able to handle monsters more easily the more contracts you land.\n\n- Confidence System\nLittle Hero has a Confidence parameter that increases when he defeats enemies and that amplifies XP. Gain more Confidence to increase the speed at which you level up. The amount of Confidence you earn will depend on how you defeat enemies, so try to gain the most whenever you get the chance.\n\n- Digest Attack\nAn offensive method that can be activated when the gauge on the upper right of the screen is full. If you defeat the enemy, you'll earn Confidence according to how many combos you get. When activated, however, you cannot summon or use items to provide support, so be sure to weaken the enemy first to get combos.",

However, since raw eggs are fragile, their durability decreases as they encounter walls and floors. The game is over when the durability disappears.\n\nFeature:\nOnline Multiplayer: Raw eggs have friends, and those friends (raw eggs) are also brave enough to go on adventures at their own pace. Every once in a while, you'll run into one of them. When you do, be sure to exchange greetings and enjoy each encounter and parting of the ways. Of course, silence is fine. Also, I can't say this out loud, but when your companion breaks up (not a breakup), he will drop a recovery item. A maximum of 10 people can play together.\n\nContinue Flag: If you place a flag, you can revive from the flag location only once. (New feature)\n\nHang on function: This is definitely the highlight of the project. It allows the egg to regain its composure after rolling around restlessly for a while. Simply put, it's a brake function.\n\nBeautiful stage: Let's have a pleasant adventure on a fantastic and graceful stage of the world.\n\nHidden items: Fried eggs will require a toast. The toast is hidden somewhere on the stage.\n\nGrowth system: The more you move, the more durable the raw eggshell will be. Even if goal is difficult, if you play without giving up, eggs will become more and more strong and it will be easier to clear. You will be fascinated by the dependable eggs.",

Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone. By removing the traditional ability to shoot enemies, this title challenges players to avoid taking damage and progress through increasingly difficult levels. \n\nThis Recharged release expands on the classic gameplay with a wider variety of deadly enemies and some new moves to even the odds. Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks\u2019 deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits. \n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Recharged title without some new beats from Megan McDuffee. Hear the music build in real time as your combo multiplier grows higher and higher. Try not to get hit! \n\nArcade Mode:\nSurvive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you\u2019re out of lives.\n\nChallenge Mode:\n25 hand-crafted levels with unique challenges such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a period of time, each designed to make you think of new strategies to conquer them.\n\nPower Ups:\nUnlimited dodges, freezing enemies, and the critical extra life will spawn to help you turn the tables on your enemies.\n\nLocal Co-op:\nCover more ground with a friend across all modes of play to strategically clear out enemies in tandem.\n\nLeaderboards:\nCompete in global leaderboards in arcade and challenge modes",

        "description": "ARK: Genesis Part 2 completes the eons-spanning story of ARK: Survival Evolved! Everything that your tribe has built, tamed, and fought for has led to this final challenge. With your faithful artificial companion HLN-A by your side, you\u2019ve emerged from the Genesis simulation to find yourself aboard a gigantic starship being overtaken by a familiar threat from the distant past.\n\nIn Genesis Part 2, you\u2019ll explore a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you\u2019ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you\u2019ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!",

Unlike Uva Academy, with its long and rich history, this school was only recently established and has a focus on teaching Pok\u00e9mon battles. What's unique about Blueberry Academy is that a large part of it is actually in the sea! Attend lessons, mingle with the local students and experience a new school life that's anything but ordinary.\n\n- You need to have completed the ending of Pok\u00e9mon Violet and Part 1: The Teal Mask to access the main story of Part 2: The Indigo Disk.",

Monsters can either be played as their signature class, or they can be played as any of the stock classes in Barony! Once you finish the game as a monster, you unlock its signature class for play as any race.\nYou can also just wear the monster skin as a costume without any gameplay changes if you prefer, and don't worry, you can still play with anyone who doesn't own the DLC.\n\nThe Skeleton requires a patient approach, which works since you don't get hungry!\n\nThe Conjurer starts with a new spell, allowing them to summon helpful allies who increase in power throughout the adventure.\n\nThe Succubus hates blessings and loves curses! She'll also start with some demonic powers.\n\nThe Mesmer has a staff, and eventually can learn a spell, which allows her to enlist the service of foes to protect her. Use your wiles to survive!\n\nThe Vampire can't eat normal food and must feed on blood instead! Vampires also start with vampiric powers!\n\nAccursed adventurers have a voracious hunger, but also have increased speed and the ability to turn invisible. The Accursed must move quickly to survive.\n\nThe Goatman eats tin cans with no need for a tin opener, and can sniff out extra potions from fountains, which is great since they gain some unique buffs from certain brews!\n\nThe Brewer starts with a handy-dandy backpack which increases their inventory space. They also have an Alembic which allows them to brew powerful potions!",
