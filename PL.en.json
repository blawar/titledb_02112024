        "description": "Stranded on the shores of a mysterious island, you must learn to survive. Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \n\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\nOver 80 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you\u2019ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment. Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\n\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\n\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces\u2014ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\n\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK\u2019s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\n\nRPG STATISTICS\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\n\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains \u201csleeping\u201d in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\n",

Separated from your family in a devastating flood, you will need to find food and shelter between terrifying torrential downpours which threaten to drown all life. Climb through the ruins of an ancient civilization, evade the jaws of vicious predators, and discover new lands teeming with strange creatures and buried mysteries.

        "description": "To The Rescue! is a dog shelter simulator where you are responsible for taking care of dozens of cute dogs in need of homes. It's not all cuddles and snoot boops though: running a shelter can be a lot of work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their chances of finding the right forever homes.\n\nEach day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more dogs.\n\nSome dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day.\n\n20% of the profit from all sales of To The Rescue! goes towards real dog shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation.\n\nEvery dog is unique.\nEach dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them distinctive and memorable.\nMatch dogs with adopters' needs. Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.\nUpgrade and customize your shelter.If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more!\nKeep the shelter open.Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter. You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can keep helping dogs find homes.\n...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs!\nTake Care of Dogs\n\nEvery dog is unique -  Each dog is generated with its own traits, food preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption.\nFulfill their needs - Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy. It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes. \nMinigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O\u2019 War, Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime\n\nBalance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses. \nEach day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to be made.\nGrow and Upgrade - Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows!\n",

        "description": "LONDON HAS BEEN STOLEN BY BATS...\n\nWelcome to Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a stone's throw away.\n\nThanks to an unknown bargain, London now resides in a vast cavern under the earth. Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. Cats spy on their owners and whisper their secrets abroad. The fabric of strait-laced Victorian society has begun to fray.\n\nNew Masters are in charge. Why are they so\u2026 tall? And always cloaked? And why are they so interested in love stories?\n\nThe possibilities for personal connection in London are different now. Thrown together in crisis, you might befriend or romance many of the characters you meet, from Griz, your assertive housemate for whom the Fall was a chance to break free of Victorian societal norms, to the infernally well-dressed gentleman at the Brass Consulate with the amber eyes.\n\nEven death itself has a twist here: the first murder victim since the Fall is feeling much better, and keen to see justice done. Unfortunately, as the doctor who treated him immediately before he expired, your housemate Archie is the prime suspect...\n\nDELICIOUS FEATURES\n\n- (Re)invent yourself: who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?\n- Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories to unlock different story options\n- Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners, each with their own secrets\n- Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself (by any definition you like)\n- Write love stories in a delightful minigame, and use them to impress the new Masters\n- Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources. How are you at rat catching?\n- Solve the first murder since the Fall, with the assistance of the victim\n- Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London\n- Seek deeper and deeper secrets over multiple playthroughs\n\nLOOKING FOR LOVE\n\nWill you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached? Or are you looking for lasting love? Perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way? Every major storyline is accessible regardless of whether your approach to love is romantic or platonic.\n\nUse an elaborate, dynamic story-crafting system to create love stories \u2013 and murder theories. Are the twists in the tale not to your taste? Then change the motive, the location, even the victim, and see how the stories adapt!\n\nMAKE YOUR MARK\n\nYour past will open different doors for you in London. What was your life on the Surface like? Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or dabble in the occult?\n\nYour clothing will also make people think differently of you. Your outfits open new possibilities in conversation: be bolder, more commanding, more flirtatious. Ingratiate yourself with London's inhabitants by changing your style of dress \u2013 they won't be able to resist you in that hat!\n\nYou'll also work odd jobs and collect resources which will open new avenues in social situations. Your housemate Griz has found you work as census-taker for those curious new Masters. Fill your census-taker's notebook with intimate details about your fellow citizens and you'll find you can pursue deeper relationships with them, romantic or otherwise.\n\n\u201cFailbetter has made each relationship the result of lots of dynamic choices and details.... which opens the door to all these new possibilities, rather than just giving you a dialogue tree that you can power through until you get the \"best\" result.\u201d\nPC Gamer\n\n\u201c...if the idea of getting your freak on in a world where tentacles slither out of mouseholes and rats build homemade guillotines leaves you a little uneasy, you can opt to pursue a platonic relationship instead. In a place like this, you sense you might need as many friends as you can get.\u201d\nEdge Magazine",

Work your way through Octane Isle's five neighbourhoods, challenging the Master Mechanics that rule each part of town. Repair as many cars, trucks, choppers, tractors, mini-subs (and even UFOs) as possible to prove your worth in this hectic race against the clock. \n\nNo two games are the same as you work your way through 25 unique garage levels, each one more challenging than the last. Completing a garage is one thing, but mastering it and beating your team's best score requires coordination, skill, and determination. \n\nThis is couch co-op chaos for you and up to three other players, working as a finely-tuned machine across local, wireless and online play. Track your team's best scores, unlock new characters and discover hidden secrets as you explore Octane Isle together. \n\nThe faster you work, the more chaos is unleashed. Fuel spills ignite, tyres explode, robots short-circuit, cows stampede and aliens abduct... just about anything can happen in Octane Isle. But with teamwork, skill - and maybe just a little luck - you'll earn the right to call yourselves Manic Mechanics! \n",

Players will get to meet mythological figures such as the Spirit Wardens, the Ox-head and Horse-face Guardians of the Beyond, and the Tudi Gong (Keeper of the Land).\n\nThe player takes on the role of Yun, a \"rewinder\" who has the ability to enter people's memories and influence their actions. By utilizing \"senses\" and swaying others' \"intentions\", he can change history. \n\nAt the request of the Spirit Wardens, Yun goes to a small village to investigate why a spirit couldn't be reincarnated. The once thriving village has been deserted and filled with resentful spirits, leaving one woman alone in the teahouse. Who's she waiting for? Where did all the other villagers go? What really happened seven years ago?",

        "description": "The Light\nCenturies passed since the High Wizard Zale sacrificed himself to save Celenheim from the hands of Vatar and his legions of Dreg\u2019Atar. The Enclave, the last bastion of the side of light, remained safe enclosed by fortress walls and bottomless chasms. However, the land is beginning to heal and the cliff sides are knitting together. The Shadow forces seek to reignite the war that almost destroyed Celenheim and steal the sacred magic held within the walls of the Enclave. It is up to you to keep the light from being extinguished. \n\nThe Dark\nThe control of Celenheim was ripped from the hands of Vatar and his legions of Dreg\u2019Atar. For years the prosperous magic sought by the darkness was hoarded in the Enclave by the soldiers of light. The great rifts surrounding the city kept Vatar and his Outlanders from breaching its walls, but their luck is beginning to change. The land is seaming itself together and the time to invade is near. The legion of Darkness is ready and it is up to you to gain back what is rightfully yours. \n\nBegin your campaign as a soldier of the Light, defending Celenheim from forces of darkness and the horrid demon king Vatar. Change sides and complete an alternative campaign as a minion of the dark tasked with infiltrating and destroying the Enclave you just sought to protect. Twelve different classes and multiple weapon options create great replayability as you descend dungeons, complete missions, and vanquish your enemies.\n\n\u2022 Experience breathtaking combat action as a soldier of light or minion of darkness across two separate story-driven campaigns.\n\n\u2022 Enhanced graphics and upgrades for Nintendo Switch\u2122.\n\n\u2022 Updated and expanded soundtrack.",

        "description": "A packed international schedule awaits, including the oldest Test Match rivalry as Australia tour England, the Test Championship Final and the 2023 World Cup.\n\nCricket Captain 2023, the immersive gaming experience that takes you to the heart of professional management. Whether you're a seasoned cricket strategist or a newcomer to the sport, this game offers endless possibilities and challenges that will keep you hooked for hours on end.\n\nWith an extensive player database featuring real-world cricketers, you'll have the power to recruit, train, and nurture your own squad of talented players. Analyse their strengths, weaknesses, and form to create the perfect combination of batting, bowling, and fielding prowess. The decisions you make off the field will determine your team's success on the field.\n\nThe new aggression system, inspired by Bazball, uses batting ability and natural aggression based on the current batting tactic, rather than the type of match being played. A generation of cricketers brought up on 20 Over Cricket have naturally aggressive styles that mean many have higher one-day averages than first class. Batting aggressively to match their natural style can improve performance.  Equally, knocking runs off at 12 an over is natural to players in the last overs of a 20 over (or even Test) match.\n\nCricket Captain 2023 also includes historical data for international player rankings and player recent form, including recent performances in Test, ODI and 20 Over Internationals. International team ranking modelled using results of every match in the four-year window. Accurate wicket keeper statistics are also included, with separate fielding stats for keepers and outfielders, as well as byes conceded records.\n\nAll domestic systems include the latest developments in India, South Africa and around the world.\n\nKey features for 2023 include:\n\u2022 Match Engine: new Bazball inspired player aggression and rating system.\n\u2022 International Team Rankings: calculated from last 4 years results.\n\u2022 International Player Rankings: with historical data, all-rounders and improved system.\n\u2022 Asia Trophy: play in ODI and 20 Over International tournaments.\n\u2022 Player Form: includes historical data, opposition and an updated system.\n\u2022 Recent Internationals: recent international player form graphs.\n\u2022 Wicket Keeper Statistics: keeper and outfield catches, byes conceded.\n\u2022 Wicket Keeper Ability: greater accuracy for keeping ability.\n\u2022 Stadium Model Updates: including new Perth stadium.\n\u2022 New South African Franchise League: six new teams.\n\u2022 Indian Domestic System: major update to all competitions.\n\u2022 Domestic System Updates: all systems updated to latest rules and formats.\n\u2022 Improved Player Generation: re-balanced with focus on player aggression. \n\u2022 New Kits: including international and Australian 20 Over.\n\u2022 Test and ODI Championships: updated for the 2023 season.\n\u2022 Tournament Modes: play in stand-alone One Day or 20 Over World Cups. Create your own World XIs, All-Time Great and Custom Match Series.\n\u2022 Interface: improved screen layout and flow.\n\nComplete Stats Update for the 2023 Season:\n\u2022 Updated player database with over 7,500 players.\n\u2022 Added historical keeper and outfield stats.\n\u2022 Updated versus, ground and team records with partnerships, bowling and batting records.\n\u2022 Updated domestic squads for all 146 playable domestic teams.\n\u2022 Updated recent series stats for all players.",

You play Gerda Larsen, a young nurse who is torn between her community and her desperate quest to save her husband, Anders. Many other lives will come to depend on your decisions. \nGerda\u2019s journey will involve moral dilemmas, difficult conversations, and sticky situations. It\u2019s a dangerous world and you must help her adapt to it with the choices you make, which always have both short- and long-term consequences.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you give away precious resources to somebody who needs them now, will you come to regret it later?

        "description": "Something stirs in the darkness of the underground mausoleum. A terracotta figurine cracks and a soul stirs within, awakened by the energy of the Tao. You wake, surrounded by eight thousand of your terracotta comrades. A curse has been placed upon the army of the first emperor, save yourself\u2026 meaning  you are the only one who can lift it and bring peace to one of the greatest spiritual wonders of ancient China.\n\n\nTerracotta is an action-adventure game based on China's seminal Qin dynasty. Though ruling only for fifteen years, the first imperial dynasty laid the foundations of a state that would endure for over two thousand years. Experience the splendor and drama, as China transforms from a patchwork of warring states to a united empire. Witness the creation of the first Great Wall of China and the grand victories that preserved its legacy.\n\n\n\nExplore the Twin Realms\n\nAs the sole uncursed warrior of the emperor's Terracotta Army, you'll have to master your ability to channel the Tao, switching between the realms of Yin and Yang to free your fellow soldiers from the spiritual blight.\n\n\nShift between the realms of Yin and Yang, within the tomb of the Qin Emperor and his afterlife, looping between death and the afterlife to overcome cursed challenges.\nYin is the domain of solitude and tranquility. The dark, desolate tomb is a fortress, where you can strategize, prepare, and alter the layout to aid your journey.\nYang is the realm of the afterlife, light, and action. Execute combat strategies, evade foes, and overcome the tomb\u2019s defenders to find the source of the curse placed upon the rest of the terracotta.\n\n\nSolve the Mystery of the Curse\n\nYou are one of eight thousand warriors bound to protect the Qin Emperor in his afterlife. Your comrades are not your enemies, even if they do not think so at the moment\u2026\n\n\nMaster your ability to channel the light of Yin, not only for switching realms but also for manipulating surroundings.\nAwaken ancient mechanisms and descend into the underworld, overcoming foes through speed and agility, instead of only using brute force.\nDefeat nine brutal bosses, requiring the mastery of the nine phases of Qi: The universal energy that forms all parts of living beings.\n\nWitness the Rise of China\n\n\nThe Qin dynasty laid the foundations of China that would endure two thousand years. As an awakened terracotta warrior, you have the opportunity to observe it from within.\n\nExperience an art style based on the timeless aesthetics of guo hua, traditional Chinese painting.\nImmerse yourself in the afterlife of the Terracotta Army with a soundtrack inspired by traditional instruments classified through the ancient Chinese ba yin.\nSave your fellow eight thousand strong warriors, each with iconic individual appearances - just like the real Terracotta Army!\n\n\n\n\nTERRACOTTA is a project funded by Red.es and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Red.es Program to promote the videogame industry. These grants are co-funded by the Spanish ERDF Pluri-Regional Operative Program (POPE) 2014-2020.\n\n",

As the seasons in the small-town change and life starts to stir, you'll soon realize that things aren't always what they seem: Not everyone is honest with themselves and others, the healthcare industry is not as illustrious as it seemed in medical school, and the work/life balance Finley strives toward might be impossible to achieve.   \n\nFall of Porcupine is an original narrative adventure and a love letter to those who are there for us whenever we don't feel like ourselves. The game tackles sensitive topics with an approachable narrative, relatable characters, and resonating dialogue featuring tons of exploration, fun mini-games, and casual platforming.\n\nFEATURES\n\nExplore A Beautiful, Diverse World\n\nNot only is there a lot to discover in the old hospital, but also in the small town of Porcupine itself. Take the time to meet the villagers and have a beer with them in the local pub, take a trip to the nearby forest, or spend quality time with your friends.\n\nHardened Professionals, Sweet Friends\n\nThe blunt head doctor, the selfless nurse, Finley's smart friends, and many other residents populate the small town of Porcupine. Engage in funny, profound, and sometimes serious dialogues, in which you'll be able to choose your answers and influence your relationships.\n\nDemonstrate Your Skills and Empathy\n\nYou don't even have time to look at the clock because your patients are waiting! Investigate what's wrong with them through your conversations and treat them in different minigames that challenge you in logic, speed, and skill. \n\nExpose Social Injustice And Structural Problems\n\nAt first glance, the small town is a warm, friendly place where everyone knows and greets each other. But if you live there for any length of time, you'll suspect that not everyone is as honest as they pretend to be \u2013 especially in an unhealthy healthcare-system. ",

        "description": "Prison Simulator is a first-person simulation game in which you play the role of a prison service officer a month before your desired promotion. You have to perform increasingly complex tasks in prison, balancing the administration's assessment and inmates' satisfaction. In the game, you play the role of a prison guard and it is only up to you whether you decide to obey the law or let this place and people corrupt you completely. After all, who said you had to be an exemplary ranger? Maybe you prefer to trade with prisoners, help them smuggle, and bet on the outcome of fights in prison instead? After all, everyone likes to have fun sometimes. Especially in a sad place like this, where you are also the boss. Or at least you think so. So how? Will you choose to follow the rules, intercept contraband, count prisoners, send them to work, take care of their basic needs and keep prison gangs under control? Will you go to the dark side? Whatever you decide, remember that your actions will affect both the facility itself and the inmates, and above all, the further course of your career.\n\nUnique features of the game:\n- try to balance between following the orders of your superiors and doing small favors for the inmates. In doing so, you will maintain a fragile balance between both and benefit from the gratitude of both parties,\n- become the exemplary prison guard in campaign mode. Receive new prisoners, search cells for contraband for confiscation, view surveillance footage, maintain peace and order, react to inmates' acts of disobedience, and complete many other tasks assigned by your superiors,\n- or ignore all rules in Free Play mode. Do what you want, discover the farthest corners of the prison, explore the surroundings and interact with prisoners. Just remember that your every action will have an impact not only on other prison guards but also on the inmates themselves. Especially if you choose to punish the latter frequently and for no apparent reason.",

A megacorporation named MK is using its power to control the population, and her community is in danger.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nShe soon discovers that she has a gift of clairvoyance that connects her to Reverie, the realm of the Aspirations of Humanity: Glory, Bliss, Power, Chaos, Bond, and Truth.\n\nIn this world, Polly becomes Harmony, an Oracle who has the power to choose the Aspiration that will ultimately rule over Reverie and restore the delicate balance between the deities\u2019 world and ours.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe fate of humanity is at stake. To which destiny do you aspire?\n\nDECIDE YOUR DESTINY\u00a0\n\nAs Polly, or Harmony, each action you take will affect both worlds and send you down sprawling narrative paths. See into the future and explore the consequences of possible choices in the Augural, a game board and visual representation of Polly's gift of foresight.\n\nIn pursuing whichever destiny you desire, you\u2019ll also bond with and obtain crystals from the Aspirations. These will unlock different paths at important crossroads that will change how the thread of the story unravels, and ultimately the fate of humanity.\n\nFIND THE NEW HEART OF HUMANITY\u00a0\n\nWhichever Aspiration comes to lead Reverie, with Harmony\u2019s help, will also become the heart of humanity. Their personality and style of rule will change Reverie while also giving the people of our world a new direction too: when the link between worlds is stronger, Reverie has a bigger influence on the state of our world.\u00a0\n\nGlory, Bliss, Power, Chaos, Bond, and Truth are all wildly different entities with their own distinct personalities, goals, and opinions on how to make things better. You\u2019ll get to know each of them as visit Reverie in your dreams as Harmony, but only you know best \u2013 as Polly \u2013 what your world needs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA COLORFUL WORLD\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs you play, revel in artistic direction that is bright, vibrant, and futuristic. Immerse yourself in the daily life of a Mediterranean city and get to know its people,\u202fwith a cast of characters who are fully voiced and animated.

He sent his son, the Prince, to Earth and ordered him to create a large katamari.\nThe Prince rolled the katamari and made the katamari bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky.\nAs the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true.\n\n\u2022 We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up!\nWe Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered.\nThe graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play.\n\n\u2022 New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available!\nIn his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood!\nThe days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges.\nWill the young King be able to clear the tough challenges?\nIn addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages!\n\n\u2022 A simple but very deep game!\nRoll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger.\nYou can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals. Once the katamari is complete, it will turn into a star that colors the night sky.\nYou cannot roll up anything larger than the current size of your katamari, so the key is to think in advance about the order in which you roll things up around the stage!\n\n* This product is based on the We Love Katamari Damacy software that was released in 2005 on another platform. Some specifications are different.",

        "description": "When you enter the world of \"RichMan 4 Fun\", you will find yourself in a property management game full of opportunities and challenges. You can experience the fun and sense of achievement of making money and managing assets. The game is played in rounds, and the number of steps to move on the map is determined by rolling the dice. You can accumulate assets by acquiring real estate, building houses, and investing in the stock market. The game also has a rich variety of card props that can help you achieve your goals more easily, defeat others, and become the richest tycoon player in the game!\n\n\u300aClassic Characters from the 4th Generation\u300b\nThe game uses classic character roles from \"RichMan 4\", such as Sun Hsiao Mei, Uncle Tuu, Madam Chyan, and so on. The original voice dialogue adds to the rich game atmosphere, making it feel more familiar.\n\n\u300aDiverse City Maps\u300b\nThe game's map design is very interesting, including many different cities and countries, including Taiwan, Japan, the United States, South Korea, and so on. Each map has unique scenery and features, and you need to master the appropriate management strategies based on the map's characteristics.\n\n\u300aReal Estate Investment\u300b\nReal estate investment is one of the main game elements. You can purchase land and build buildings of different levels on it, thereby collecting tolls from passing opponents. In addition, you can also build special commercial buildings, such as gas stations, shopping malls, and hotels, to further increase your income and strategic advantage.\n\n\u300aStock Market Investment\u300b\nStock market investment is a game element that requires intelligence and experience. By using your savings to buy and sell different stocks, you can earn substantial profits, but you may also suffer losses. You can use relevant cards and props to help you succeed in your investment journey.\n\n\u300aRich Cards and Items\u300b\nCard items are a highlight of the game and can be obtained in the card shop or during map progress. These include the ability to control steps, seize land cash, build or demolish houses, welcome or curse opponents, etc. These items can help you implement your own strategy while also dealing with attacks from opponents.\n\n\u300aDivine Possession\u300b\nIn the game, you can gain the power of divine possession to raise your luck to new heights. The power of good gods can lend you a helping hand and help you gain more benefits in the game. However, the existence of evil gods may cause you trouble, so you need to be careful and avoid their influence.\n\n\u300aLottery Betting\u300b\nDon't miss the lottery station on the map where holding a ticket brings endless hope! On the 15th of every month, you have the chance to win and change your destiny. Every purchase of a lottery ticket is like a little adventure, making people inexplicably excited and anticipative.\n\n\u300aDestiny and News Events\u300b\nAs Salombas often said, \"Life is often unsatisfactory, with eight or nine difficulties out of ten.\" Destiny and news events are unexpected and exciting elements that make the game more challenging and uncertain. The sudden event may give you a huge fortune or make you face unexpected difficulties and challenges.\n\n\u300aMini-games\u300b\nThere are various types of mini-games on the map, each with unique gameplay and challenges. They not only provide extra fun but also allow you to earn points to purchase card items and gain greater advantages in the game. Proficiently mastering mini-games and card item usage can greatly improve your winning rate and enjoyment!",

Travel to an abandoned communist resort and use your unique psychic abilities to uncover its deeply disturbing secrets, solve dual-reality puzzles, survive encounters with sinister spirits, and explore two realities at the same time.\n\nThe Medium is a third-person psychological horror game that features patented dual-reality gameplay and an original soundtrack co-composed by Arkadiusz Reikowski and Akira Yamaoka.\n\nBECOME A MEDIUM\nWield unique psychic abilities reserved for those with the gift. Travel between the realities or explore them both at the very same time. Use the Out of Body experience to investigate places where your real-world self can\u2019t go. Create energy shields and deliver powerful spirit blasts to survive the spirit world and its otherworldly dangers.\n\nSEE WHAT\u2019S HIDDEN\nDelve deep into a mature and morally ambiguous story, where nothing is what it seems and everything has another side. As a medium you see, hear and experience more than others, and with every new perspective you will change your perception on what happened at the Niwa resort.\n\nPLAY IN TWO WORLDS AT THE SAME TIME\nNever-seen-before and officially patented gameplay that plays out across two worlds displayed at the same time. Explore the physical world and the spirit world simultaneously, and use the interactions between them to solve dual-reality puzzles, unlock new paths, and awaken memories of past events.\n\nENTER A DARK REALITY INSPIRED BY BEKSI\u0143SKI\nThe Medium\u2019s spirit world is a dark mirror reflection of our reality, a grim and unsettling place where our unpunished deeds, evil urges, and vile secrets manifest themselves and can take on a form. This world has been invented and designed under the inspiration of Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski\u2019s paintings, Polish dystopian surrealist internationally recognized for his distinctive and strikingly ominous style.\n\nMUSIC BY YAMAOKA & REIKOWSKI\nImmerse yourself in the disturbing and oppressive atmosphere of the game thanks to the original \u2018dual\u2019 soundtrack co-created by Akira Yamaoka and Arkadiusz Reikowski. Yamaoka-san is a legendary Japanese composer best known for his work on the Silent Hill series; Reikowski is a Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee who worked on such acclaimed horror games as Blair Witch, Layers of Fear, and Observer.

Take your time, explore and soak up every word.\n\nTwo extraordinary strangers\nFrank and Drake are two extraordinary strangers brought together by unknown forces in a conspiracy that threatens them both. Sharing the same apartment, though destined never to meet, they must work together to uncover the mystery shrouding both their existences. \n\nFrank is the super of a run-down apartment block in Oriole City, worried he is losing his mind and what little remains of his connection to the world around him. Drake is allergic to sunlight and operates by night. Both experience visions and have unanswered questions about their pasts. Could the answers they seek be in these mysterious experiences? Their split existence means they must communicate via sticky notes left around the apartment. Despite this separation they must forge a relationship, uncover the mystery and survive.  \n\nOne compelling conspiracy\nPlay both characters alternately: Frank during the day, Drake at night. What choices they make will affect what the other can do in the future. Though they must work separately, their fates are intertwined and depend on the trust and friendship they forge together. \n\nThe game is set in Oriole City, a richly detailed and beautifully illustrated setting, full of mystery, remarkable characters, and secrets to unearth. Frank and Drake must explore these surroundings, solve puzzles and discover clues that will help them find the answers they desperately seek, to their respective  troubled pasts. \n\nWhat choices will you make? \nThe mystery unfolds via a branching narrative, where the choices you make will have a profound impact on the events Frank and Drake experience. Multiple playthroughs will be rewarded with the discovery of new perspectives on the story, as well as unique puzzles and mini-games. Which path will you choose? Will you discover all the secrets hidden in the world?\n\nFrank and Drake employs a beautiful graphical style that represents the unnerving and dreamlike existence that both characters feel with the world around them. The rotoscoping style is a painstaking process of hand drawing frames over filmed footage. The uncanny result reflects Frank and Drake\u2019s realities: two extraordinary characters trying to blend into an ordinary world. ",

Have you ever wondered who would win, King Arthur (aided by Merlin) or a sword-wielding Alice of Wonderland? How would Sinbad and his trusty porter fare against Medusa and the three harpies? The only way to find the truth is in battle with a quick game of Unmatched!\n\nIn Battle The Are No Equals!\n\nWhat is Unmatched?\nUnmatched: Digital Edition is a tactical game where each player commands their hero and sidekick(s), using a unique deck of cards, to defeat their opponent on the field of battle.\n\nThe rules are simple. On your turn, take two actions which can be:\n- Maneuver: Move your fighters and draw a card!\n- Attack: Play an attack card!\n- Scheme: Play a scheme card (cards that have a special effect).\n\nGet your opponent's hero to zero health, and you win the game.\n\nWhat makes the game special is that each hero has a unique deck and ability. Alice grows big and gets small. King Arthur can discard a card to power up his attack. Sinbad gets stronger as he goes on more voyages. Medusa can damage you with just a glance.\n\nWhat makes Unmatched great?\nUnmatched is one of those easy-to-learn games with an incredible amount of depth. The tactical insight and knowledge of your hero and your opponents will determine the outcome of the fight. Games are quick \u2013 but play out very differently! Your decisions will determine your fate, and your skill (and just a bit of luck) will win the day.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n* Epic duels between the most unlikely opponents!\n* Huge tactical depth!\n* Stunning artwork by legendary artists!\n*Three levels of AI for solo play!\n* Near infinite replayability!\n* Easy to learn, hard to master!\n* In-game tutorial and rulebook!\n* Online multiplayer!\n* Synchronous and asynchronous game modes!\n* Official Unmatched rules consulted with the designers of the board game!\n* Multiple expansions to come - bringing new heroes and maps!\n* Unique experience of a board game with the convenience of a digital platform!",

But not that of the senile shepherd Lars, but of his countless other sheep. Because after such a long wait, Sven has built up pressure. A lot of pressure!\n\nDiscover over 25 ways to dance the horizontal tango, churn the butter and plant the parsnips. Not only Sven has needs after such a long time: The sheep are also just waiting eagerly to finally be seduced again. \n\nThe longer they have not been satisfied, the more frustrated they get. So Sven is doubly motivated to knead the dough and put the bread in the oven.\n\nBut beware of shepherd Lars and his attentive dog Wotan, because they both guard the flock with watchful eyes. If they catch Sven on his love odyssey, it's high time to scram. If they catch him, all the fun and games are over.\n\nFor the first time, it is possible to dance the no-pants-dance in real 3D. This not only helps to get a better overview of the animals waiting to be made happy, but also to love through the world more smoothly. Sven\u2019s movement has been improved as well as the AI of Wotan and Lars revised to make for exciting rounds and requiring a tactical approach for the most beautiful affair in the world.\n\nIn addition, for the first time in a part of the Sven series, it is possible to start an orgy with up to 4 players. No pants\u2019ll stay dry. Smash!\n\n\u2022 The first Sven game in real 3D, lovingly animated by hand\n\u2022 The best of both worlds: Be both the active and the passive part\n\u2022 3 different game modes: Singleplayer, Co-op, Versus\n\u2022 20 exciting and challenging levels\n\u2022 Over 25 ways to make the sheep world happy\n\u2022 Use crazy items, now also actively usable thanks to an inventory \n\u2022 Local multiplayer mode for up to 4 players\n\u2022 Compete with players from all over the world via the online high score list!\n",

To maintain security, Earth imposes martial law, but a federation of colonies led by the colony of Secilia overthrows the Earth\u2019s government and plans to obliterate the planet and all the people on it. To counter this, Earth sends out a covertly-developed fighter codenamed the R-Gray in hopes of penetrating the Secilian atmosphere and obliterating Secilia\u2019s base of operations, the Juda Central System.   \n\nRayCrisis is set in a cyberspace environment and marked a style departure from the rest of the series. As a prequel to RayForce, it details the events during which the supercomputer called Con-Human gained sentience and rebelled against its human creators. While the Earth is demolished to be remade as Con-Human\u2019s new corporeal form, a mecha-neurologist launches a desperate assault to jack into the supercomputer\u2019s virtual core and cease its insanity. It is up to you to pilot the Waverider viruses and keep the malicious AI from causing any more chaos - even if it could be too late, you must ensure that no more lives are lost in the real world by stopping Con-Human in the digital realm.  \n\n\n\n",

        "description": "How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.\n\nUse camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.\n\nFeatures\n+ Solve over 200 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.\n+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.\n+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n\nGameplay\nOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.\n\nThis can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become. ",

        "description": "Homebody is a nostalgic survival horror puzzle game where you catch up with old friends and try not to get murdered.\n\nEmily and her college buddies have gathered at a remote rental house to watch the Perseid meteor shower. They try to rekindle the bonds they once had, but lingering emotional wounds and social anxieties leave Emily feeling more alone than ever. When the power suddenly goes out, it\u2019s almost a relief. But under the cover of darkness, a mysterious killer picks them off one by one. If Emily can\u2019t find a way out, she\u2019ll be trapped in this nightmare forever.\n\nEvade the killer, solve the house\u2019s devious puzzles, and reconnect with your friends. Escaping the house may seem impossible at first, but with each attempt to put the pieces together, the bloodstained picture becomes more and more clear.\n\nA Nostalgic Trip\nInspired by retro horror games and classic 80s slasher films, Homebody sets the scene for a thrilling evening. This retro-but-modern game pulls players through a deeply strange and emotional experience.\n\nAn Unsettling Getaway\nEmily and her friends gather for the annual viewing of the Perseid meteor shower. But with relationships strained and anxieties high, what should be a relaxing weekend quickly goes awry, turning even darker as a mysterious killer picks them off. \n\nJust One Night Together\u2026 or Is It?\nAfter a bloody night, Emily wakes back up in the foyer. Realizing something is horribly wrong, Emily must find an escape, no matter what it takes. Learn more about Emily\u2019s relationships with choice-driven dialogue. Stealthily explore the house, moving quietly and hiding in closets to evade the killer\u2019s responsive AI. Death may be inevitable, but knowledge never dies. Use an in-game journal to track the clues and puzzle solutions, piecing together this mysterious event.\n\nDevious Shifting Puzzles\nWith continually changing challenges in the house, puzzles will require strategic and creative thinking to solve. But be careful and work quickly, time continues to tick on and the unpredictable killer stalks the house looking for Emily and her friends.",

        "description": "Nova Strike is a retro shoot 'em up that transports you to a distant galaxy where you face waves of increasingly powerful enemies. Because it is easy to pick up and play, has addictive gameplay, and generates different levels with each new game, you can enjoy hours of challenging fun. Every time you take off is a chance to unlock new upgrades and improve your ship. Try to beat your high score!\n\nFIGHT FORMIDABLE FOES\n\nDestroy as many enemy ships as possible while skilfully dodging their attacking fire. After defeating mighty armadas, a formidable boss stands in your way. You need to watch, learn and anticipate the attacks of each boss to stand a chance of defeating them. Push yourself to your limits to complete the perfect run and beat the high score.\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR WEAPON LOADOUT\n\nYour ship has nine secondary weapons to unlock and equip as well as some 40 defensive and attacking skills. From missiles to grenades to electric forcefields, every upgrade creates a different game experience. Build a ship to suit your style and refine it between each level during your stops at the spaceport. Every customization radically changes the tactics you need for annihilating enemy squadrons. Choose carefully and find the best configurations to suit your play style.\n\nEACH GAME IS DIFFERENT\n\nPlay and play again: every Game Over is the start of a new adventure. Using the persistent points you earn with each run, unlock new weapons and skills, then start a new game to explore a fresh procedurally generated map. Come back stronger and stronger until you can confront the final boss and save the galaxy!",

Go back to a time of innocence where things like work, responsibilities or relationships were the last thing on your mind.\n\nBring Life and Charm Back to the Farm\n\nThis little homestead needs a lot of attention. A variety of fruits and veggies to grow and a vast collection of animals to raise. Protect your crops,  keep your animals happy and gather the resources to repair and expand your farm. Explore the open world and get to the bottom of what is giving you these magic dreams at night.\n\nCreate an Animal Paradise\n\nEverdream Valley has very few people disturbing the peace so animals thrive here. Pigs, cows, chickens, ducks, goats, alpacas, horses, sheep, bees, wild boar, magpies, beavers, bison, geese, deer, frogs, beetles, butterflies, dragonflies, wolves, mice, snails, slugs, fish and more! Each comes with some unique influence on your farm. \n\nThe Best of Fluffy Sidekicks\n\nAt your side will always be your dog. Choose from 10 different breeds and train them to help with herding, tracking, finding treasure and more. There's a cat too. Win him over and maybe he'll do something for you in return too. That's up to him really.\n\nThe Magic Comes Out at Night\n\nAt night the magic of the valley comes out and your dreams let you become one of many animals on the farm through unique mini games. Each has its own special reward or impact on your farm the next day.\n\nA Relaxed Sandbox of Adventures\n\nYour summer days in the valley aren\u2019t just about looking after the farm. There\u2019s so much more to do! Spend the nights camping, build a treehouse, catch and collect bugs, go fishing, get new clothes, cook, take photos, build furniture, go treasure hunting. Each adventure gives you something back to help you grow your farm even more.",

You\u2019ll decide who Grace allies with, who she can trust, and who may betray her in this beautifully hand-illustrated roleplaying musical.\n\nWritten by David Gaider comes Stray Gods - an urban fantasy tale of finding your place, taking charge of your fate, and discovering answers. Your choices will change the endings, as well as the path you take to get there.\n\nA compelling story of hope, self-discovery, and forging your path.\n\nFind Your Voice\nAdventure, love, and songs await!\n\nCharm, negotiate, or strong-arm your way through their world as Grace, playing through original, fully interactive musical numbers composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory, Tripod (musicians Scott Edgar, Steven Gates, and Simon Hall) and Eurovision Australia\u2019s own Montaigne (Jess Cerro). Fully orchestrated and performed by an all-star cast, you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019re right there on the stage. With thousands of potential variations based on your choices, you\u2019ll craft the soundtrack to your own one of a kind musical experience.\n\nFind Answers\nChoice and consequence built from the DNA of RPGs - no two playthroughs are the same.\n\nDelve into a hidden world of mythic Greek gods and monsters as you get to know a cast of hilarious, enigmatic, and compelling characters. Forget what you know about these mythological beings - in Stray Gods you\u2019ll forge friendships and find foes with many familiar names, but not so familiar stories. Play as star and stagehand as you determine the story you want to tell through conversation and song.\n\nFind Love?\nFind friendship, love, or yourself.\n\nBuild friendships with mortals and Gods alike. Stoke the fires of romance if you so choose - explore, pursue, and confess your love with four potential paramours. Decide who you want to be through every choice. David Gaider\u2019s storytelling and characters come to life with performances by an all-star cast, with the likes of Laura Bailey, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn  and more cast members across video games, television, and Broadway to be revealed soon.\n\nA Whole New World\nA musical for video game lovers, and a video game for musical lovers.\n\nWith all the comedy and tragedy of your favorite stage shows, Stray Gods is a tongue-in-cheek and heartfelt reconception of Greek mythology combining what we love about contemporary musical theater with video games where character and story take center stage. Collaborating with some of the best in music, broadway, television, and games - Stray Gods is a debut not to be missed.",

It\u2019s a choose your own adventure, stay in the garage if you want.\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure\n\nIt's been 20 long years since a nameless cool guy rose from the streets, punched the big bad, found his father and everyone was really happy or something. Welcome to the future, it's corrupt, sea shells have replaced toilet roll and everything's cyberpunk now. Walk the same, but now neon, streets as you're thrown into an adventure filled with hilarity, 80\u2019s nostalgia and punching.

Increase your stats and techniques, plan your match and create your own incredibly awesome school of fighting! Sounds better than losing and everyone laughing at you.

Even if there is a slight risk you\u2019ll be exposed as a fraud and your last brain cell will pack up and leave.\n\nManage\u2026Everything\n\nLife in the rat race is fast paced, time consuming and requires effective management to survive, Punch Club 2 is the same!

Completing quests will give you access to new fighting schools, moves, dollars, good person points and even the Lion Queen on VHS! \n\nThe first rule of Punch Club, is tell everyone about Punch Club, wishlist it now or prepare to fight (for legal reasons, we won\u2019t actually fight you).

Enter the Days of Doom, a post-apocalyptic tactical RPG roguelite that challenges players to reach Sanctuary, a place of promise and respite in a world of colorful chaos. Starting with a small cast of survivors, you\u2019ll chart a path to reach your ultimate destination, encountering threats, including zombies, raiders, and even zombie raiders! Along the way you will need to recruit a ragtag band of heroes to protect your growing community and fight your way forward. \n\nDiscovering how to best utilize each hero's unique abilities is the key to success in Days of Doom\u2019s turn-based combat. Attack with Pyro early in the battle, as he ignites enemies for lasting damage. Then combine the Hydromancer and the Thrasher in a one-two knockout punch. Hydromancer can set the stage with a ranged water attack, and then the Thrasher can deliver a shocking surprise to wet enemies. The odds against you may seem insurmountable, but if you use your heroes' abilities strategically, upgrade them, and add new abilities along the way, you might just make it.\n\nNo two runs are ever the same, which keeps you at the top of your game, and makes Days of Doom inherently replayable. \n\nFeatures\n\n- Beautifully animated hand-drawn art that brings the quirky vision of the post apocalypse to life\n\n- Eight character classes, each equipped with unique default and special abilities\n\n- A dozen enemies from the archetypal zombie, to deadly raiders, to explosive monstrosities and two surprisingly brutal boss fights\n\n- Over 50 randomly occurring events that present risk-reward scenarios\n\n- Over 70 items and runes to collect to turn the odds in your favor\n\n- Roguelite progression means no two runs will be the same, but you permanently upgrade stats like party size and speed of resource accumulation, which means each run will get you closer to reaching your goal\n\n- Original orchestral soundtrack by Jelle Dittmar",

Test your skills and perseverance as you overcome the progressive disease that threatened Monet\u2019s eyesight and solve puzzles to help the painter complete some of his greatest masterpieces.\n\nAbout the Game:\nThe Master\u2019s Pupil is a puzzle adventure where you will travel across the iris of Claude Monet and help him complete his masterpieces.\n\nThroughout the game, you will encounter and overcome increasing challenges as Monet experiences loss, like the passing of his wife Camille, and struggles with the cataracts that threatened his art making. Consider color, space, and physics as you traverse the world of his eye - as one wrong color combination or move can end your journey.\n\nKey Features:\n- Hand Painted and expertly crafted - almost every part of this game has been painstakingly made using a real paintbrush in real life before being imported to the world. The results are unique visuals reminiscent of Monet\u2019s Impressionism that change and adapt over his lifetime.\n- A Biographical Adventure - experience a life\u2019s story in a way that has never been done before. No language or text describes the man or his actions, instead navigate intricate landscapes based on Monet\u2019s real paintings, and journey through a unique rich soundscape. All matched with an emotional and moving score by indie composer Steven W Schouten.\n- Calm and Relaxed - An artist doesn\u2019t rush but takes their time when completing their work. The Master\u2019s Pupil gives you time to consider each puzzle, with tests that will challenge your brain but not your reflexes.\n",

They made things that others couldn't. Do you want to be remembered? You'll have to earn it. Your companions have captured the German bunker during the Battle of Normandy, and your task is to defend it at all costs. Defend your bunker! It won't be easy though.\n\nSoldiers are humans and between fighting, they need to rest, get fed, and regain their energy. The enemy won't wait for you to get ready. The day is short. Many tasks await you. Prepare food to regain some strength.\nThe sky is full of enemy aircrafts. It's hard to get enough supplies from your allies. You must scavenge whatever you can to survive. Search the bodies of those killed in battle - sometimes you will even find chocolate! Remember to check the supply regularly as you must also take care of your companions. Order wisely and share food.\n\nIf you don't have enough bandages, food, or ammunition, send a message to the command with a request for a supply drop. It is mandatory to enter the password in the Morse code. Receive encrypted messages and anticipate your enemy's plans.\n\nThis is why you are here. Perform missions - be vigilant and make good use of your machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and anti-tank cannon.\n\nRemember: Soldier's fate... never changes. You thought 101st Airborne Division got famous for nothing?",

In addition, we have also designed a wide variety of offbeat, special \u201cweapons\u201d \u2013 nail gun, pitching machine, fireworks launcher, and even railgun!

Discover wild, forest, and mountain valleys, filled with unexpected fun moments and exciting challenges.\n\nYour goal as a bee is to explore these unknown valleys, searching for flowers and collecting nectar to make honey in the hive. But don't be fooled, it's not as easy as it seems. Learn to fly like a real bee in the characteristic zigzag style known as the 'Dance Bee'.\n\nEach mission becomes more challenging, with increasing time pressure. Your time limit is determined by the honey percentage in the hive, and the pace of honey consumption accelerates with each mission.

Now, with the purpose of restoring the spirit of Halloween and his trade, Scary must destroy FaceBoo! and its 3 divisions; Darkchat, Deviltube and RipTok\n\n\"Death or Treat\" is a 2D action-roguelite and hack & slash, with handpainted environments and traditional animation. Explore all the worlds and defeat hordes of enemies using different weapons and skills.\n\nYou will play as Scary, the owner of Ghost Mart, leader in manufacturing candies for Halloween.\n\nDiscover huge worlds, explore new maps and try to survive the hordes of enemies. It\u2019s not an easy task, every world is even more tricky than the other. Starting with Darkchat, Riptok, Deviltube,  and  last but not least FaceBoo!, the ultimate epic frontier.\n\nCombat is one of the fundamental pillars of Death or Treat. Choose your favorite weapon style (fast, heavy or ranged) and face a real horde of enemies in the purest hack'n slash style: fly through the air and attack the crowd with force, move nimbly and look for their weak point.\n\nEach one of the stores that you will find in HallowTown can provide different profit for your enterprise. You can create new weapons at Frank's Forge, or buy healing potions at DetoxBucks. Our vampire shopkeeper, Joe Bite Them, will help you get new empty slots for your inventory, and the Pumpkin guys will teach you how to craft magic spells. Finally, go to Pumpkin\u00a9 to trade your ingredients for more candies!",

The plans for the dam started during the Fascist era, opposing the interests of a big industrial group to the wellbeing of the villagers, who were forced to leave their homes and pastures.\n\nThe main character of the game is a painter visiting today's Curon Venosta, the new village built after the flooding. The painter is dragged into the lake by a mysterious woman and wakes up in the past, in the old village of Curon as it was before the flooding.

        "description": "Story:\nDr. Fetus\u2019 Mean Meat Machine takes place right after the events of Super Meat Boy Forever. After meticulously analyzing Meat Boy all throughout  Super Meat Boy Forever (did you notice the cameras in the levels???), the nefarious Dr. Fetus now has all the data he needs to create the perfect Meat Boy clone! There\u2019s just one problem: The DNA sample he\u2019s collected isn\u2019t a perfect specimen, which in turn yields some\u2026less than perfect clones\u2026 \n\nBut fear not, Dr. Fetus knows how to solve this problem. He creates a bunch of ruthless test chambers and starts sending all of the clones he\u2019s created through them, in order to weed out the crap clones from the good ones. The specimens start out looking nothing like Meat Boy, but over time that grotesquely lovable face that Dr. Fetus hates so much, starts to emerge. Perfect clones are just on the horizon and after they\u2019re done\u2026who knows what happens next? Probably something to do joyously with torturing and killing lots of Meat Boys for the hell of it!\n\nAbout The Game:\nDr. Fetus` Mean Meat Machine provides the perfect combination of classic puzzle-gameplay and hardcore platforming elements that Super Meat Boy is known for.

But can Little Hero and his clandestine companions truly restore peace to their land? An adventure of mother and child\u2060\u2014and pooch\u2060\u2014begins...\n\nHow to Play:\nVarious monsters stand in the way, but Little Hero is much too young to handle them all himself. Support him in being victorious by first weakening the monsters with your summoning powers. Little Hero will gain Confidence to defeat more monsters and grow stronger. Help Little Hero increase his level and prepare for the final boss showdown!\n\nSystem:\n- Partnership Chance\nThis event increases your chances of landing a contract with a defeated boss, with any remaining HP increasing your chance of success. Here's your opportunity to twist boss monsters' arms into signing away!\n\n- Contract System\nWhen luck is on your side, you'll get a chance to offer a contract to the monsters that Little Hero defeats at the end of the stage. Monsters who sign can be set in the Grimoire, allowing you to summon them. You'll be able to handle monsters more easily the more contracts you land.\n\n- Confidence System\nLittle Hero has a Confidence parameter that increases when he defeats enemies and that amplifies XP. Gain more Confidence to increase the speed at which you level up. The amount of Confidence you earn will depend on how you defeat enemies, so try to gain the most whenever you get the chance.\n\n- Digest Attack\nAn offensive method that can be activated when the gauge on the upper right of the screen is full. If you defeat the enemy, you'll earn Confidence according to how many combos you get. When activated, however, you cannot summon or use items to provide support, so be sure to weaken the enemy first to get combos.",

However, since raw eggs are fragile, their durability decreases as they encounter walls and floors. The game is over when the durability disappears.\n\nFeature:\nOnline Multiplayer: Raw eggs have friends, and those friends (raw eggs) are also brave enough to go on adventures at their own pace. Every once in a while, you'll run into one of them. When you do, be sure to exchange greetings and enjoy each encounter and parting of the ways. Of course, silence is fine. Also, I can't say this out loud, but when your companion breaks up (not a breakup), he will drop a recovery item. A maximum of 10 people can play together.\n\nContinue Flag: If you place a flag, you can revive from the flag location only once. (New feature)\n\nHang on function: This is definitely the highlight of the project. It allows the egg to regain its composure after rolling around restlessly for a while. Simply put, it's a brake function.\n\nBeautiful stage: Let's have a pleasant adventure on a fantastic and graceful stage of the world.\n\nHidden items: Fried eggs will require a toast. The toast is hidden somewhere on the stage.\n\nGrowth system: The more you move, the more durable the raw eggshell will be. Even if goal is difficult, if you play without giving up, eggs will become more and more strong and it will be easier to clear. You will be fascinated by the dependable eggs.",

You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic.\n\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\n\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks.\n\nKey game features:\n- transport passengers between bus stations\n- a variety of bus models\n- build roads, stations, traffic lights completely free\n- upgrade stations to large bus hubs\n- upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types\n- beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings\n- build road network freely\n- build traffic lights to each junction\n- automatic breakdown generation\n- automatic road crack generation\n- various demolishing tools",

Take control a twin-tailed fighter wielding a beam saber and swat the ball towards block targets above. Some blocks drop power-ups, while others take multiple strikes to break. As the action intensifies, enemy ships will appear and fire at you, propellers will deflect shots, turrets will track your position and more, adding a tough-but-fair bullet hell element. Once you\u2019ve cleared all 36 main stages, you can also push your limits with endless challenges. How long can you last?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Battle through 36 stages of brick-breaking arcade action!\n\u2022 Meet a cast of 9 crossdressing \u201cotokonoko\u201d characters, all voiced in Japanese.\n\u2022 Change ball speeds, collect power-ups, dodge enemy attacks and deflect incoming fire.\n\u2022 Master 2 unique game modes, including endless challenges for unlimited replay value!\n\u2022 Earn points to exchange for new outfits and backdrops in any order you desire.\n\u2022 Assemble custom dioramas using the characters and clothing you\u2019ve unlocked.",

In this game where we progress chapter by chapter, we are trying to reach the places requested from us by using the pipes extending from the ledges or trying to catch the keys placed in certain places.  As you progress, not only the distance the pipes have to travel increases, but also the pipes are in different colors and need to be placed according to the correct color design, making your game more difficult but more enjoyable! Taste the different and varied level designs and try to progress with the right strategies!\n\nUse the right strategy to get through the levels that get more complicated as the map grows! \nChange your character's color as the level and pipes dictate and try to get the keys placed in certain places in the shortest way possible!\nChanging color palettes and atmospheres from level to level will give you a different experience in every level! \nThe quick restart option allows you to quickly restart levels and search for different paths!",

Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone. By removing the traditional ability to shoot enemies, this title challenges players to avoid taking damage and progress through increasingly difficult levels. \n\nThis Recharged release expands on the classic gameplay with a wider variety of deadly enemies and some new moves to even the odds. Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks\u2019 deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits. \n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Recharged title without some new beats from Megan McDuffee. Hear the music build in real time as your combo multiplier grows higher and higher. Try not to get hit! \n\nArcade Mode:\nSurvive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you\u2019re out of lives.\n\nChallenge Mode:\n25 hand-crafted levels with unique challenges such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a period of time, each designed to make you think of new strategies to conquer them.\n\nPower Ups:\nUnlimited dodges, freezing enemies, and the critical extra life will spawn to help you turn the tables on your enemies.\n\nLocal Co-op:\nCover more ground with a friend across all modes of play to strategically clear out enemies in tandem.\n\nLeaderboards:\nCompete in global leaderboards in arcade and challenge modes",

The Ghost Face DLC includes two exclusive items for The Ghost Face: the body Monochrome Maniac and weapon Silvery Steel Tactical Knife. These items are only available as part of the DLC.\n\nAcquaintances are a dangerous deception. The workplace is filled with them; strangers seated beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise. No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.\n\nThe Ghost Face took full advantage of that fact, blending in the everyday. He would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. \n\nBut this time he found a richer hunting ground\u2026\n",

        "description": "Having risen from the depths of the ocean to fight in Square-wide struggle, the underwater-breathing, fish-like Aquarion have summoned their aquatic allies to take dominion over their land-dwelling kin. \n\nUnlike the other tribes, the Aquarion have a unique style of gameplay. Instead of getting Riders, Knights, or Giants, the Aquarion are given replacements, the quick Amphibian, ranged Tridention, and hardy Crab, respectively. These units are all amphibious, meaning they can move from land to water tiles, and back, with ease! The Aquarion are also given new replacement technologies to make this new gameplay style possible.\n\nThe Aquarion have a unique relationship with the water that other tribes don\u2019t have. While they still have access to the standard naval units, the Aquarion have new units that excel in amphibious hit and run tactics. The Amphibian, Tridention, and Crab all have Escape, meaning they are very hard to pin down when near a coast, as they can simply retreat away from enemy attacks. Since Aquarion terrain is full of water, they are able to get out onto the seas very easily!\n\nAquarion Features:\n\n* Rise from the briney deep and conquer the land as Aquarion!\n\n* Tame the amphibious Turmelon!\n\n* Raid the coasts with the agile Amphibians!\n\n* Use trident-throwing Tridentions to wrest control of the seas!\n\n* Enforce your dominion of the oceans with powerful Crabs!\n\nIf you like a tribe that has a unique water-based gameplay, or you simply have a fondness for the sea, then the Aquarion are the perfect tribe for you!",

Emerging from isolation in a mystical forest, the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014bwill stop at nothing to uncover the magical secrets of the Square. The \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b are known for surrounding themselves in the magic of the forests, using their powers to lure woodland denizens to their Sanctuaries for profit, bargain with awesome dragons, and enchant animals into soldiers to help them fight.\n\nUnlike the other tribes, the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b have a unique style of gameplay. First, the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b get markers in the Fog of War showing where ruins are, meaning they don\u2019t need to scout as much for them. Also, the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b consider nature divine, and their worship of nature prevents them from deforestation for a quick profit or hunting animals for food. Instead, the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b can build Sanctuaries, which will provide resources based on the amount of adjacent animals. The \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b are also unable to harvest whales for resources, and instead will use their magic to transform them into the fearsome Navalon, which can obliterate a navy single handedly! In addition to whales, the Elyrion can enchant animals in their territory into Polytaurs, which can be used to supplement an army or work as part of an early game rush. Lastly, the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b don\u2019t get Giants, but get flying Dragons, instead, which must grow up from an egg before they can be used.\n\nIf you like tribes that are against the grain from what you\u2019re used to, or you simply want to fly on the back of a majestic Fire Dragon, then the \u2211\u222b\u1ef9ri\u0231\u014b are the tribe for you!",

        "description": "From the frozen wastes emerge the Polaris, servants of the mysterious Gaami, who are hellbent on freezing the Square into a new frigid paradise. Imbued with icy powers granted by their overlords, the Polaris construct adorable Mooni, freeze the waters, shatter their foes, and diligently work their way toward an unforeseen fate...\n\nUnlike the other tribes, the Polaris have a unique style of gameplay. Their most prominent trait is their ability to freeze terrain, transforming the land and water into frozen versions, and replacing terrain features with their own. Due to being able to transform water into ice, the Polaris do not have access to a navy, and are instead given replacements, the Battle Sled and Ice Fortress for Ships and Battleships, respectively, which can effortlessly skate across the ice. Instead of beginning the game with a Warrior, the Polaris start with a Mooni, an adorable ice construct which can freeze adjacent terrain or nearby units, rendering them helpless until they thaw. The Polaris replace their normal Archers with Ice Archers, which deal no damage but freeze units from a distance. The Polaris also replace their Giants with Gaami, physical avatars for their extradimensional masters, which can instantly freeze nearby terrain and bring an entire army to its demise. Lastly, due to not having waters or ports, the Polaris replace their Customs Houses with the singular Ice Bank, which provides stars based on the amount of frozen terrain on the Square.\n\nThe Polaris take everything you know about naval combat and throw it out the window, as their lack of a navy means that they\u2019ll have to get creative when conquesting over the seas. Using Mooni and Gaami in conjunction can stop an opposing navy from even leaving the harbor! The ice will grant the Polaris forces movement bonuses and allow for their sleds to operate, which are designed to defend the land they\u2019ve frozen. Freezing the terrain will also provide the Polaris with an income, should they acquire their Ice Bank. Freezing a unit will stop it completely, preventing actions such as movement or counter attacks, allowing Polaris forces to destroy opposing units with impunity.\n\nPolaris Features:\n\n* Send the Square into an eternal winter with the magic of the Polaris!\n\n* Build adorable Mooni and spread the snow far and wide!\n\n* Skate on the ice with the formidable Battle Sleds!\n\n* Construct Outposts to help your people navigate the ice and snow!\n\n* Reap the rewards from the Ice Bank!\n\n* Fortify your borders with Ice Fortresses!\n\n* Use Ice Archers to freeze your opponents solid for easy kills!\n\n* Study under the tutelage of the mysterious Gaami!\n\n* Bring about a new ice age from which the Square will never recover!\n\nIf you like tribes with incredibly powerful ice magic that freezes their foes, or simply want to spread a world-wide Winter Wonderland, then the Polaris are the perfect tribe for you!",

A new map, the disturbing Garden of Joy, is available for all players. Purchasing this add-on also unlocks an exclusive outfit for Haddie: The Pale Piped Shirt. \n\nThe Killer is The Dredge. A formless mass of twisted limbs writhing in the shadows, The Dredge is a manifestation of repressed darkness. All light will drain in the presence of this unsettling abomination. Look no further than the once-idyllic Garden of Joy, left forever tainted by The Dredge\u2019s gruesome appetite.  Yet few stand bolder than Haddie Kaur. Fuelled by courage, determination, and a dash of morbid curiosity, this explorer of haunted corners leaves no stone unturned in her quest for eldritch understanding.  ",

Opposite to Gerda\u2019s empathic approach, Liva is not afraid of using violence and often struggles to tell revenge from justice. You will have to carefully balance her fury towards the enemy, duty towards her mission and country, and care for her teammates. \n\nA good leader is a good listener: your small team of 4 have different opinions and attitudes. They will challenge you as well as seek guidance and support as they risk certain death for Denmark. Will you become the leader your team needs?\n",

        "description": "Use skills honed on ARK's faraway Island to kill, tame, breed, and ride the fantastical new creatures that have evolved to survive the Desert's ultra harsh conditions, including... DRAGONS! Travel back and forth between the Island and the Desert to team up with hundreds of players across both worlds or play locally!\n\nEXPLORE A NEW WORLD\nScorched Earth takes ARK players to an entirely new land, composed of six unique, desert themed biomes \u2013 dunes, high desert, mountains, canyons, badlands and oasis \u2013 each with their own aesthetic and ecosystem. Littered with ruins, geysers, and intricate ancient cave systems, survivors will find a whole new frontier to explore and master.\n\nTAME NEW CREATURES\nThe biomes of Scorched Earth are filled with dangerous new creatures, and the intrepid survivor will find that many of them can be tamed. Among others, lead a caravan of the camel-like Morellatops, or rain fire down upon your enemies from the back of an elemental Wyvern. Just mind your step, or you might attract a Death Worm!\n\nCRAFT OVER 50 NEW ITEMS\nUsing what resources they can scrounge together, survivors can craft distinct new outfits and structures to beat the heat, and new tools to help them survive in this desolate environment. Players can use whips, boomerangs, flamethrowers, chainsaws, and much more to defend themselves, or such things as tents, wells, wind turbines, and oil refineries to provide their bases with resources. When used creatively, these tools can open up whole new strategies for survival, self defense or epic tribal warfare.\n\nCONQUER NEW CHALLENGES\nPrepare yourself for dangerous electrical storms, blinding sand storms, befuddling heat stroke, and unleash the power of the mysterious Obelisks to come face-to-face with the ARK\u2019s deadliest boss creature to date \u2013 the ferocious Manticore! Does it protect a powerful weapon, a precious relic, or the mysteries of the ARK itself? Only survivors who posses the courage to confront this fearsome beast will learn the truth.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN ARKS\nSurvivors can take their character, favorite creatures and items between the Island and the new Desert ARKs, making their Island-dwelling friends jealous with all of the amazing new items, structures, creatures and secrets they find in the Desert.\n\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains \u201csleeping\u201d in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\n\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!",

        "description": "CONQUER EVERY MISSION\nA holographic guide to the simulation, HLN-A, offers a wide array of missions at varying difficulty levels, for you to tackle at your own pace \u2014 everything from gunning down waves of enemies with the aid of power-ups, escorting vulnerable baby creatures to their parents, tracking and hunting down powerful bosses, competing in Dino Races, even playing a round of Dodo-Basketball, and much more. The simulation itself isn\u2019t perfect, so you can earn extra credit (and experience) by fixing the glitches scattered all throughout the world. Completing missions earns you Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, TEK items, travel between environments, and more.\n\nEXPLORE LETHAL LANDSCAPES \nARK: Genesis features beautiful biomes ripe for exploration \u2014 but they all want you dead. The simulator tests your mettle across fetid alien bogs, deep undersea trenches, frigid mountain peaks, dangerous volcanic hellscapes\u2026 and even the wild low-gravity surface of an alien moon. Conquering each area requires preparation, smarts, and the ability to improvise so that when a volcano rains fire from the sky, an avalanche buries you, or a whirlpool pulls you into the briny deep, you\u2019re ready to meet the challenge! \n\nHUNT AND TAME NEW CREATURES\nThe environments may be dangerous, but they\u2019re nothing compared to the new creatures who call ARK: Genesis home: web-spinning spiderlike beasts, cute-but-deadly shapeshifters, sea turtles the size of islands, and lava lizards that act as living forges. Plus, who doesn\u2019t want to fly around on an immense hyperspace-capable space whale? Master the simulation, and you can test yourself against a mysterious new boss\u2026 the likes of which ARK has never seen before.\n\nGEAR UP AND BUILD UP\nAs you brave the many dangers of ARK: Genesis, take some time to craft new gear. Wield weapons like combo-capable plasma claws and remote-guided cruise missiles. Make tools from fishing nets to mining drills, or new vehicles such as hover-skiffs. Build interactive structural elements such as pressure plates, alarm systems, jump pads, ocean platforms and more. Whether you\u2019re a go-it-alone survivalist, a weapon-making warmonger, or a base-building architect, this expansion has a crafting project suited for you.\n\nWILL YOU PASS THE TEST?\nARK: Genesis takes your story in an all-new direction \u2014 and your skill determines your success. Everything is turned up to the highest setting: the challenges, the dangers...and the vast rewards. Only the toughest and smartest survivors will pass all of the simulation\u2019s many tests. Will you be one of them? ",

        "description": "ARK: Genesis Part 2 completes the eons-spanning story of ARK: Survival Evolved! Everything that your tribe has built, tamed, and fought for has led to this final challenge. With your faithful artificial companion HLN-A by your side, you\u2019ve emerged from the Genesis simulation to find yourself aboard a gigantic starship being overtaken by a familiar threat from the distant past.\n\nIn Genesis Part 2, you\u2019ll explore a vast new world teeming with strange biomes and exotic creatures, while engaging in story-oriented missions that test your mettle, ingenuity, and survival skills. Wielding an array of powerful new tames, items, weapons, and structures, you\u2019ll journey from idyllic fields through twilit phantasmagoric realms, all the way into a hellish heart of darkness. Thousands of years and trillions of miles away from where your story began, you\u2019ll challenge series-villain Rockwell in a final confrontation to determine the fate of humanity. The future is in your hands, Survivor -- one last time!\n\nNEW STORY-ORIENTED MISSIONS\nA holographic guide, HLN-A, offers a wide array of engaging new story-oriented missions at varying difficulty levels, as you build strength to confront Rockwell in a final battle for the ages. Completing missions earns you new map-wide bonuses and Hexagons, which you can spend for extra resources, additional Engram Points, TEK items, travel between environments, and more. Discover Explorer Notes and environmental cues along the way to learn even more about the history of the ARK saga.\n\nEXPANSIVE WORLDS TO CONQUER\nIn ARK: Genesis 2, you\u2019ll emerge from the simulation into a gargantuan starship filled with unique biomes, including beautiful elysian fields, an exotic twilight realm of highly evolved lifeforms, the depths of outer-space, and even the innards of the ever-expanding Rockwell himself. Whether it\u2019s sentient alien plants, Rockwell\u2019s digestive fluids, or asteroids warping in from intergalactic space travel, each biome presents unique hazards, but also opportunities to acquire new resources and creatures -- including the powerful new \u2018Mutagen\u2019 that enables you to further evolve your existing tames!\n\nSTRANGE NEW CREATURES\nThroughout the vast expanses of Genesis Part 2\u2019s world, you\u2019ll find the brain-controlling Noglins, elegant high-tech Stryders, the cuddly mobile-nursery Maewing, and even the laser-shooting, bomb-blasting, barrel-rolling Astrodelphis starfighter -- among other fantastical new creatures and evolved R-Variants of old favorites! \n\nYou\u2019ll need all the help you can tame, as both Genesis expansions present you with challenging new bosses and minibosses that will take all of your skills to conquer.\n\nPOWERFUL NEW GEAR\nAs you brave the many dangers of this new world, you\u2019ll gain access to powerful new tools to aid you. You\u2019ll learn how to place remote cameras, pull off tricks with a floating skateboard-like Hoversail, take care of your eggs with the high-tech Incubator, shoot arrows made of pure energy with the Tek Bow, even engage in a Real Time Strategy command mode within the new Exo-Mek --- and far, far more! \n\nCOMPLETE YOUR JOURNEY\nARK: Genesis Part 2 concludes the epic saga of ARK: Survival Evolved -- the ultimate battle between the freedom to evolve, versus the oppression of controlling life\u2019s creation. Which side wins out is up to you, Survivor. Your skills, your tames, your weapons and your builds -- everything that you\u2019ve accomplished is put to the test here, as the future of humanity hangs in the balance!",

A potential architect of humanity\u2019s extinction, The Singularity is intelligent beyond measure and entirely void of morality. Dead by Daylight: End Transmission also includes a new Survivor \u2013 Gabriel Soma. Created from engineered DNA by the Huxlee corporation, the resilient Gabriel emerged as the lone survivor after The Singularity went rogue and slaughtered his entire crew.  ",

        "description": "Legacy of the Moonspell introduces a brand new stage, new characters, new monsters, and new weapons to slaughter them with. There might even be some hidden mysteries for those of an inquiring mindset, but we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of vampires\u2026\n\nThe Fall of Clan Moonspell\nIn eastern lands, a clan has fallen. The Moonspell, once vigilant guardians of a sorcerous valley nestled in the mountains, have been overrun by hordes of yokai and oni. Though treacherous, this hive of spectral activity may provide some clue as to the location of a vampire. If not, at least it\u2019ll be entertaining to defeat thousands of wayward spirits in the process. \n\nNew Content\n8 New Characters including:\nMiang Moonspell - The last disciple of the Moonspell Clan before its downfall, and possibly its finest. Self-consciously a shounen protagonist.\n\nMenya Moonspell - One of the few surviving Moonspell elders, Menya\u2019s mystical powers are near god-like. \n\nSyuuto Moonspell - Banished practitioner of the new moon dark magic, Syuuto is nonetheless an enemy of evil. Poor personal hygiene may contribute to his continued exile.  \n\nBabi-Onna - Returned from the dead to seek vengeance on demons and mortals alike, she nonetheless retains her impeccable ability to charm, amuse, and dazzle.\n\n13 New Weapons between base versions and evolutions, including:\n\nSilver Wind - An ancestral force unleashed by the staff of the Moonspell Clan, only those born under the moon can fully wield its power (or whoever finds it in a chest, we\u2019re not sure). \nFour Seasons - A set of orbs which unleash the power of the changing seasons, of death and rebirth.\nSummon Night - A weapon which drips with the darkness of the new moon. Despite the clan\u2019s superstitions, even the shadows can oppose evil. \nMirage Robe - An enchanted kimono, weaved on a loom from the silk of the earth spider, and imbued with a fragment of Babi-Onna\u2019s vengeful spirit. Besides, it looks fabulous darling.\n\nNew Stage\nMt.Moonspell - Our biggest stage yet, a sprawling map featuring several different environments, all with their own challenges and resident monsters! This one stage includes an abandoned castle, snow covered mountain, and a yokai infested village, and more besides.\n\nNew Music Tracks\n\u266b Legacy of the Moonspell\n\u266b Festive Breeze\n\u266b Rumble Kachara\n\u266b Haze of Night\n\u266b Hell Night\n\u266b Crystal Allure",

        "description": "Tides of the Foscari is the second DLC expansion for Vampire Survivors, introducing another huge stage as well as a slate of new characters, monsters and weapons to play with. And of course, secrets may be lurking in the shadowed canopies of the deep forest\u2026 But as always we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of vampires.\n\nNestled deep within a continent-sized forest is Foscari Academy, a school where the elite of the world train their children for careers as powerful wizards, indefatigable generals, and expert spies. The Academy is divided into three houses, a premise hitherto untouched in all of fantasy fiction. Three students, one from each house, brave the journey into a forest stuffed with mythological creatures, all to have a jolly adventure, with absolutely nothing interrupting the whimsy. This is all mind-blowingly original stuff, we know, but it only gets better folks.\n\n8 New Characters \nIncluding a cast of extremely original and not remotely derivative character archetypes, such as:\n\nEleanor - Star pupil of The Azure Tower and a skilled magic user, Eleanor is as bright as she is shy. \nMaruto - Undefeated champion of The Crimson Anvil. Stern, brooding, but with a heart of gold beneath his scowl, Maruto is a man of few words and strong arm.\nKeitha - Sly, quick-witted, and fun loving, Keitha will do anything for a bit of adventure and levity. Deliberately stays near the bottom of class rankings in The Amber Sickle to avoid hassle.\nLuminaire - The guardian of Lake Foscari, Luminaire is an ancient witch of great power and pure heart. Known in stories as the Lady of the Lake, or sometimes the Arboreal Mistress.\n\n13 New Weapons \n\nAlso including a range of unique weapons, definitely not drawn from the personal media tastes of a selection of game devs:\n\nSpellString - Eleanor\u2019s trusted textbook, sure to provide the answers on any magical topic that might cross her path.\nEskizzibur - Forged by Maruto\u2019s blacksmith uncle as a jape, but to his surprise his young nephew was capable of lifting it. \nFlash Arrow - Keitha\u2019s home crafted arrows will put a hole through a tree at 100 paces, though her prodigious tendon strength certainly helps.\nPrismatic Missile - A fragment of concentrated elemental power loaned to Luminaire by spirits as thanks for her continued protection of the natural world.[/list]\n\n7 New Music Tracks\n\n\u266b Tides of the Foscari\n\u266b An Introduction to Sorcery\n\u266b Slaying Dragons\n\u266b Hide and Steal\n\u266b Frozen in Time\n\u266b The Heart of the World\n\u266b The World Eater\n\nA Brand New Stage \n\nLake Foscari - An enchanted forest stuffed with fae mysteries, mythological entities, and beasts you\u2019d find in any given RPG bestiary. The perfect place to have an average adventure with zero complications.",

He sent his son, the Prince, to Earth and ordered him to create a large katamari.\nThe Prince rolled the katamari and made the katamari bigger and bigger, rolling up all the things on the earth. The katamari that he created floated in space, sparkling, and brought back the lost starry sky.\nAs the starry sky was restored, the King's fans gradually grew in number all over the world. The King wanted to respond to the wishes of his fans for his success, and the Prince kept rolling the katamari to make everyone's dreams come true.\n\n\u2022We Love Katamari Damacy has been powered up!\nWe Love Katamari Damacy, the second title in the Katamari series released in 2005, has been remastered.\nThe graphics have been completely redesigned, and the in-game UI has been revamped to make it even easier to play.\n\n\u2022New additional features such as Royal Reverie are also available!\nIn his youth, the King received a strict education from his father, the Great King. New challenges have been added where you can roll around as the King in his boyhood!\nThe days of hard study and intense training can all be rolled through in 5 all-new challenges.\nWill the young King be able to clear the tough challenges?\nIn addition, a selfie mode has been added, allowing the Prince and his cousins to take quick photos while rolling through the stages!\n\n\u2022A simple but very deep game!\nRoll the katamari, roll up objects, and make the katamari bigger.\nYou can roll up anything from paper clips and snacks in the house, to telephone poles and buildings in the town, to even living creatures such as people and animals. Once the katamari is complete, it will turn into a star that colors the night sky.\nYou cannot roll up anything larger than the current size of your katamari, so the key is to think in advance about the order in which you roll things up around the stage!\n\n*This product is based on the We Love Katamari software that was released in 2005 on another platform. Some specifications are different.\n*Contents/specifications are subject to change without notice.\n*The main game is also sold separately. Be careful of duplicate purchases.",

        "description": "A legendary arcade game developed by Dimps in 2005. This fighting game gained popularity for its smooth visuals powered by S.M.A as well as the high level of strategy driven by its 2-gauges system. And with the addition of new current-gen features it's even easier to play.\n\n-Battle Mechanics Polished to a Shine by a Legendary Studio Known for Fighters:\nThe first original fighting game from Dimps, known for being involved in a number of other fighting games. It has continued to attract fighting game fans since its release in 2005 with mechanics that use 2 gauges--one for offense and one for defense--and slick 2D visuals powered by S.M.A. (Smooth Model Animation).\n\n-New Features for Console Provide a Modern Gameplay Experience:\nThe console version contains new features such as an Online Versus Mode--a first for the series. It uses Rollback Netcode, which corrects lag between players, making for a streamlined experience online. And with 16:9 wide-screen support, AI and a training mode, you can fully enjoy this game in the comfort of your own home.\n\n-Main Game Modes:\n\u30fbArcade\n\u30fbSurvival\n\u30fbTime Attack\n\u30fbLocal Multilay\n\u30fbOnline Multiplay with rollback netcode\n\u30fbTraining\n\u30fbGallery\nAdded features: Spectator mode, rematch, match recording, combat range and match time settings, assist mode, new character colors, button assignment for Boost Dive, and an updated training mode including character-specific gauge and enemy attack/dodge/ground recovery settings, as well as adjustments to enemy auto recovery timing.\n\n-The Story:\nIt is the end of the 20th century... A large-scale natural disaster struck the eastern area of a nation. It wiped out the financial sector and resulted in a staggering loss of life.\n\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, the conglomerate PROBE-NEXUS, commonly known as Probe, began reconstruction efforts in that eastern area. Colossal capital and cutting-edge technology was poured into rebuilding it. Skyscrapers that put the old high-rises to shame along with the world's biggest shopping mall and recreational facilities. This was the dazzling birth of a symbol for the new century. It was christened Zone Prime.\n\nAnd now, in an undeveloped sector of its western block, there was an area known as the slums...\n\n3 Additional Characters:\n-Greed:\nA survivor of the illegal fighting organization \"Valor\". He joined the tournament \"F.F.S.\" again in order to fight against a yet-to-be-seen strong fighter.\n\n- Hazama:\nA new president of the PROBE-NEXUS, ostensibly to support the new chairman, Beatrice. But behind the scenes, he is working in the dark to extend his own power.\n\n- Beatrice:\nA granddaughter of Mr. Brad. And after his retirement, she succeeded him as Chairman of PROBE-NEXUS. Despite of her beauty, she has an extremely cold personality inside.",

        "description": "Grab Ichigoichie's two fresh musical strategy titles in one package, and control your own soundtrack at a great price! Each game is built with Ichigoichie's Original Music Engine (OME) which creates the game's soundtrack directly from each choice you make while clearing levels. No two play-throughs ever sound the same!\n\nAbout Backbeat\n___________________________________\n\nEXCELLENCE IN SOUND DESIGN NOMINEE: BitSummit X-Roads\nSELECTED INDIE EXHIBIT: Tokyo Game Show\n\nStephanie \"Watts\" Watson, an aspiring bassist, bounced from audition to audition never finding music that really resonated with her, that is, until she discovered the magic of funk. Caught up in the groove, she recruits a group of hometown amateurs to take on art school darlings La Tormenta at the Battle of the Bands.\n\n=== MUSIC ===\nJoin Watts as she grows on a musical journey rooted in funk and fusion. Soulful grooves and hot licks are composed by Pete Fraser, session saxophonist to the The Pogues, Friendly Fires, and Field Music! Twenty musical motifs are recorded by a live ensemble of seven funk masters, providing the foundation for the dynamic music in the game. Unique songs are generated depending on what directions and paths you take in each puzzle. Customize your performance with alternate playing styles, instruments swaps, and realtime audio effect pedals.\n\n=== MECHANICS ===\nEach character in your band moves through the map in different ways, encountering unique solutions and obstacles. Advancing a character consumes a turn and part of the timeline, setting up interactions with other characters and enemies at different points in time. Rewinding a turn undoes your move, allowing you to find improved solutions and new ways to tackle problems.\n\nManipulate each character separately, rewinding or fast-forwarding along the timeline in the process to reach her current point in time. Changes in time are reflected in the progress and actions both past and present of each character, creating some possibilities and removing others.\n\nEach character has his own resource-limited super move which can be triggered under certain conditions. Tip toe through tight spaces with your bassist, slide through guards with your keytar player, break through walls with your drummer, or blow enemies out of the way with your mighty super sax. Strategic use of your super moves increase the number of solutions to each puzzle and are the key in gaining a maximum score.\n\n=== CONCEPT ===\nBackbeat is a homage to the 16 and 32-bit story-driven games of the 1990s, recreating the challenges and victories of the last days of analog life and the birth of the internet. The suburban Washington D.C. area is reflected in diner parking lots, shopping malls, and dimly lit arcades.\n\nA colorful cast of supporting characters both friend and foe join Watts as she struggles with leadership, success, and holding together a band.\n\n\n\nAbout Hexagroove: Tactical DJ\n___________________________________\nHexagroove combines elements of strategy, rhythm, and action games in a unique blend of self-expression. Your goal as a DJ is to combine musical loops in real time to regulate a virtual audience's energy, working them into a state of euphoria with your artistic skills. The action swings from contemplative to frantic as you move between song sections in one of ten dance music genres. Over time you'll unlock new musical loops, DJ tricks, and club venues to play in. Perform together with friends in your room or on the dance floor with this truly creative title.\n\nWINNER: BEST GAME AUDIO BALTIC SEA GAMES AWARD, BITSUMMIT GAIDEN SELECTION\nNOMINATED: INDIECADE 2020 BEST GAME AUDIO, GRAND JURY AWARD, PLAY21 MOST CREATIVE GAME AWARD\n\nWith musical content from Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands by: Mr. YT (Yuji Takenouchi), missingsoul, Legowelt, CYLON, Runners Club 95, no. 9, SEXY-SYNTHESIZER, D\u00c9 D\u00c9 MOUSE, Big Skapinksy, TWIDDL, Kristoffer Wallman, lallow, DISPOSABLE, Junya Nakano, and Yasuo Sato",
