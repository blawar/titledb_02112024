        "description": "Xeno Crisis is an arena shooter in which one or two players take control of battle-hardened marines embarking on a deadly mission to confront an alien menace and get home alive! Run and gun your way through thousands of adversaries as you explore the devastated research outpost, searching for survivors, and ultimately facing the origin of the outpost's demise.\n\nOutpost 88 is divided into seven distinct areas, each being randomly generated with each play, meaning that your strategy must evolve on the fly if you're to succeed in your mission. Collect dog-tags from vanquished enemies to upgrade your equipment between areas and look out for special weapons which will give you a momentary advantage.\n\n* A faithful port of the hit 16 bit game with added extras.\n\n* Incredible pixel art from the legendary pixel artist, Henk Nieborg.\n\n* Intense FM chiptune soundtrack by Savaged Regime, originally created for the YM2612!\n\n* Two difficulty levels and three modes of play.\n\n* An arsenal of 10 weapons to master.\n\n* Play solo or local co-op with a friend!\n",

Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!\n\nEverything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia\u2019s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot to mine the world\u2019s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.\n\nThe stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron\u2019s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron\u2019s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia\u2019s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she\u2019s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it\u2019s too late. \n\nOur hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Baron\u2019s Digsites before it\u2019s too late...\n\nKey Features\n\u2022\tStunning visuals - Intricate pixel art aesthetic inspired by retro classics\n\u2022\tOriginal soundtrack - GameCube inspired soundtrack by composer Dale North (Wizard of Legend)\n\u2022\tExplore the world of Sparklite - Five beautiful, procedurally generated biomes\n\u2022\tInvent your arsenal - Invent gadgets to solve puzzles and defeat enemies\n\u2022\tBattle bosses - Take on the Baron Mining Corp and its formidable gremlin Titans\n\u2022\tMeet the locals - Befriend the people of Geodia and help build The Refuge\n\u2022\tHunt collectibles - Discover collectibles scattered throughout the world\n\u2022\tBuddy up! - Rescue Ada\u2019s robotic sidekick to play local assistive co-op with a friend\n",

With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe.

        "description": "You are Sprocket, an adorable ferret on a remote space station. Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the most stuff!\n\nWidget Satchel is a thrilling adventure for one little thief, with fiendish puzzles, joyous platforming, and dozens of hidden collectables. As you stumble deeper though the station evading your human caretakers, you steal things like widgets and socks. And you stash them, because you\u2019re a ferret.\n\nEvery widget you collect adds to the weight of your satchel, making it a little harder to reach the next platform or avoid the station\u2019s maintenance bots. Stash enough widgets, and you can use them to fabricate doohickeys, which help you unlock new paths and previously out of reach areas. It\u2019s a ferretroidvania!\n\nBut don't worry: You may lose some widgets (or your socks!), but Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no \"game over.\" And nothing is blocking your path to the shuttlebay, so the game is only as challenging as you want it to be.\n\nIt's up to you: race though the station at top speed, or meander around knocking over piles of junk and hitting bots with your wrench. Or\u2026 gather up all your ferret-y determination to stash away each widget, discover every trinket, and try on all 30+ pairs of socks -- including a Nintendo Switch\u2122 exclusive pair of \u201cJoy-Sock\u201d that match your Joy-Con\u2122 colors!\n\nEven after you finish the game, the adventure isn't over. Escape your playpen again (and again) to pursue different challenges. Ferret out all those hard-to-reach areas for a higher widget count, knock around more junk for a greater mischief score, or zoom through the station for a faster finish time.\n\nThe more you play, the more of the game's 20+ unique \u201cfeats\u201d you're likely to accomplish, and the more you\u2019ll discover about the station, its human crew, and the Expedition they\u2019re a part of.\n\nJust remember: Commander Key misses you, and is waiting patiently for you to return to her\u2026",

        "intro": "Contraptions is a physics based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look and feel to it.",
        "description": "How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.\n\nUse camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.\n\nFeatures\n+ Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.\n+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.\n+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n\nGameplay\nOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.\n\nThis can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become. ",

        "description": "Smash, clobber and bash the murderous legends of Slavic mythology in this darkly funny action role-playing game that changes every time you play. Play as Ivan, a one-handed blacksmith with incredibly bad luck, who must take on the impossible tasks given to him by the tzar. All the while the mysterious witch, Baba Yaga, watches over Ivan\u2019s fate. \n\nThe world of Yaga is a world steeped in Slavic folklore and ancient Pagan beliefs. Featuring a head-bobbing Romanian hip-hop soundtrack from Subcarpa\u021bi and striking, hand-drawn 2D artwork. Yaga is an authentic love letter to childhood fables from Romanian indie developer, Breadcrumbs Interactive.\n\n\u25cf Bludgeon the ancient monsters of Slavic folklore using a vast arsenal of hammers and tools forged by Ivan\u2019s own hands.\n\u25cf Your actions change Ivan\u2019s story, his reputation, and the upgrades he can choose.\n\u25cf Experiment in the deep forging system to make weapons like teleporting lightning hammers and hookshot pitchforks.\n\u25cf Explore the combinations of talismans, magic items, blessings, perks, and curses to fundamentally change how Ivan plays.\n\u25cf Multiple endings, multiple ways of solving encounters, procedural map, lots of characters to encounter, and hidden secrets mean Yaga is meant to be played over and over again.\n\u25cf Ivan\u2019s grandma just wants him to find a wife. Don\u2019t disappoint her!",

Featuring gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map.\n\nPlayers wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions. In this way the in-game stories themselves act as a currency to progress through the game, and it\u2019s up to the player to pair the right story with the unique needs of each of the characters that you will encounter throughout your travels. Only through these right pairings will characters reveal their true selves, and bestow you with the most powerful stories, the true ones which reveal something about their own lives. In Where The Water Tastes Like Wine, stories organically take on a life of their own as they grow larger and transform as they're told- and re-told.",

As the sun sets over Atlantic Island Park, you must explore its dilapidated rides in search of your son, Callum. As darkness falls, you will experience panic and paranoia through a narrative written by a team of award winning storytellers. \n\nAmusement parks are happy places, filled with the joys of childhood and the exhilarating rush of fantastic rides to be dared. That was the vision of eccentric business man Nathaniel Winter when he opened the doors to Atlantic Island Park in 1977.\n\nUnfortunately, the park's history turned out to be one plagued by tragedy and drama. Its freak accidents, grotesque killings and ghostly hauntings have inspired many a sensational headline, and locals worry the park is far from done claiming innocent lives.\n\nFor Lorraine, it's where her worst nightmare began.\n\n- Explore Atlantic Island Park and step onto rides such as the Ferris Wheel, the Bumper Cars and the Rollercoaster; just beware, some of them have a life of their own\n\n- Enter the mind of Lorraine, a woman facing every parent's worst nightmare, and unravel her story as well as the dark and tragic history of the park\n\nWARNING: This experience deals with subject matter that might prove emotionally distressing to some.

        "description": " It's also a Metroidvania where you don't have to kill anyone.\n\nThe strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?",

        "description": "Zenith is an action RPG that combines that feel of the golden era RPG games with a generous dose of humor and parody. The game counts with a solid story which unfolds in a fantasy world populated by dozens of unorthodox characters. Adventuring, exploring ruins, accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world\u2026 you\u2019ve done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he\u2019s a bit fed up with the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he\u2019s in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that\u2019s not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement. Specially when you\u2019re trying to keep a dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one complex.\n\n-Explore a world of possibilities in a fully-realized fantasy realm. And one of those world map things we used to love.\n\n-Face huge bosses, dangerous foes, and angsty teenagers.\n\n-Find tons of parodies and pop culture references. Let's see if you can recognise them all.\n\n-Save the world. Sorta. Granted, it's a bit of a clich\u00e9. But hey, it works.\n\n-Unlock special abilities and upgrade basic combo movements with an all-powerful \u201cfinal blow\u201d-type move.\n\n-Evade the cruel and overrated real world with a long single player campaign. \n\n-Well, not as long as that one with the guy with the white hair, SURE, but we're an indie studio, dammit!",

Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control over our lives and humanity?\n\nAs she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument\u2014 and as she begins to question everything about her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.\n\n\u2022 A thought-provoking story told in the form of a visual novel from an award-winning indie team.\n\n\u2022 Follow Evelyn\u2019s journey through a present-day Seattle brought to life with beautiful hand-painted art.\n\n\u2022 Get to know Eliza\u2019s clients and the employees of Skandha, the technology giant behind it, with over a dozen fully-voiced characters and powerful performances from a highly regarded cast.\n\n\u2022 An evocative, ambient original score by the composer for Infinifactory, SHENZHEN I/O, Opus Magnum, and EXAPUNKS.\n\n\u2022 Is AI-driven counseling better than nothing? Is it worse than nothing? What responsibilities come with technical skills? Consider your own answers to these questions and more.\n\n\u2022 Counseling sessions getting a little too real? Relax with Kabufuda Solitaire, a new take on solitaire using Japanese kabufuda cards.",

The Lings, your workers, will obey you and help you with your village. But beware, they can cause a lot of problems too. If this is not enough, there are other creatures that will try to do the same, they can trade, fight or help you. Oh, don't forget about the weather and some unexpected events.\n\nVILLAGE BUILDING\n\nBuild your own village with many types of buildings, you need to decide what kind of objects, items or workbench you want inside. There are more than 150 items to craft. Every item and object has a reason. For example, craft a Wood Cabinet and put it inside the houses to increase your storage space. Roads can make them walk faster... and more.\n\nYOUR WORKERS\n\nThe Lings works for you. You need to provide basic salary, food, clothes and a \"\"healthy\"\" environment. It's up to you to decide how they work and where. Beware, they can start conflicts with each other and even set your village on fire. Watch them talk and keep your eyes open for their stats. Each one has unique traits and also attributes that you can control.\n\nDISCOVER\n\nSandbox maps with random generated nature based on your initial profile. Custom maps that you can build yourself. Talk, trade or fight with other races. Collect treasures and sell it or use it on your community. Random events that can turn your whole village into a nightmare from day to night. See how weather impacts your food and workers.\n\nAND MORE!\n\nRain and snow will change not only the visuals, but how you will handle your village. Craft better clothes or they can get sick. Craft better weapons and armors to face evil creatures or random thieves. Accept contracts and make enough Surplus (our currency) to make your community bigger. And, if everything goes wrong (or bad for you), you can just sell the village!\n\nWELCOME TO COMMUNITY INC!",

Bribe your way onto early departures, but don't let yourself go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping rough and begging for aid! Trade items for profit, and collect the equipment for the conditions you'll face: but too much luggage will slow you down...\n\n80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that never stops running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons, boats, camels, horses and more leave and arrive minute by minute. \n\nEvery city and journey is narrated via an interactive story where you control every action. Will your choices speed you up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your time? Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await! \n\n* \"We\u2019ve been dreaming about this future for decades. Guess what? It\u2019s here.\" - New York Times\n\n* \"Interactive storytelling as its best\" - The Guardian\n\n* \"This brilliant interactive novel re-imagines Phileas Fogg's journey around the world... One of the finest examples of branching narrative yet created.\" - The Telegraph\n\n* \"For people who love high adventures and good writing, 80 Days is a voyage that must be taken\" - The Verge\n\n* \"A brilliantly paced, memorable and quite frankly terrific piece of modern interactive fiction, that masterfully blends strategy, resource management and adventure\" - IndieGames.com\n\n* \"This is modern storytelling that engages and delights, and the bold, stylish artwork gives 80 Days almost a graphic novel feel. Pack your case, armchair Passepartout - adventure awaits!\" - Joystiq\n\n* \"Is it a game? Is it a story? Both, really. And a delight.\" - The Telegraph - Best Novels of 2014\n\n* \"Could be the best interactive fiction game out there\" - 148 Apps\n\n* \"A sublime video game to immerse yourself in\" - The Examiner\n\n* \"One of the most extraordinarily memorable and unique games I\u2019ve played in years\" - Pocket Tactics \n\n* \"Innovative and extraordinary, and unpredictable fun\" - Apps Zoom\n\n* \"Rich with ideas, brilliantly written, and creates a world that you'll want to visit over and over again\" - PocketGamer (gold award)\n\n150 cities to explore. Millions of journeys. Detailed research and techno-fantasy combine in an 1872 of tensions, inventions and exploration.

Forge gear, develop party members\u2019 skills, and alter their outfits without changing gear in this edition of the game! This version also lets you ride and attack with monsters on the field to earn experience points, as well as change between HD or 16-bit visuals, symphonic or synth music, and English or Japanese audio. Complete the tale with new character-focused stories, and travel to past DRAGON QUEST worlds!\nAcross the land, you\u2019ll meet the mysterious Tockles\u2014creatures that allow you to visit 2D, 16-bit versions of areas from popular entries in the series like DRAGON QUEST IV and DRAGON QUEST VIII! It\u2019s fun to see these classic worlds reimagined in retro style, meshing perfectly with the main game\u2019s 2D mode. Like all past DRAGON QUEST games, this one\u2019s character designs are based on the signature style of famed artist Akira Toriyama. Paired with the voiced dialogue, the rich personalities of your most loyal companions and fiercest enemies are brought to life, so you can fully immerse yourself in this quest to discover the Luminary\u2019s true heritage and awaken your power. For a greater challenge, start the game with the Draconian Quest setting, and capture your favorite moments with Photo Mode!",

Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies, cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.\n \nYour mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures\u2026 and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.",

Simple enough, right?\n\nNot when your choice of questions is\u2026 less than co-operative. And the answers seem to make no sense. So choose wisely, and try to read between the lines. Because what is communication without interpretation? Bound to fail, that\u2019s what!\n\nWe should probably mention you\u2019re on a timer, too. No pressure.\n\nTalk It Out features:\n- Odd questions and downright rude responses\n- Short game rounds for quick coffee break fun\n- 2 additional unlockable item packs\n- 3 difficulty settings (because who wants to win ALL the time?)\n- 6 character choices that affect gameplay\n- A chance to make new friends!\n- Tons of opportunity for misunderstanding and losing friends!\n- A cat with underwear on its head for some reason",

On the way, you\u2019ll visit different islands, discover stories of their people, and learn about souls and dragons. \n\nAt its core, this title is all about surviving in a hostile world as a peaceful traveler. You must deal with hunger, thirst, and energy. You can fish, customize your boats and even cast magic spells. There is no one single correct way to play.

Soul Searching conveys feelings that rarely appear in games. It deals with themes like growing up, isolation, search for meaning, and direction. It\u2019s a personal expedition deep into your soul.\n\nOutside the main story, you can try a multiplayer in the random mode where up to 4 players work together on generated maps. More players mean more resources needed to survive - cooperation is vital. Also, there are seven other short stories that experiment with different ideas about gameplay and storytelling. Be sure to check them out; you may find them exciting and innovative. \n\nFeatures: \n\n- Single-player mode with a deep and emotional story.\n- Random mode for 1 to 4 players that randomly generates a map and requires players to work together to survive.\n- Creatures at sea: dragons, killer whales, and more.\n- Many islands, some inhabited with lots of people who have intriguing stories to tell.\n- Magic skills that let you survive at sea more easily.\n- Player appearance customization.\n- A day-and-night cycle that affects the gameplay subtly.\n- Bonus short stories with an experimental vibe.  \n",

        "description": "Get some milk, kill the traitors, save Hell and rescue the hottest demoness from the clutches of those nasty people and mega-corporations!\n\nBig Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\u00e9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging.\n\nThe player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.\n\nEver wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine\nSave Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that's right - Hell! It's not the place it used to be - Hell's been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people. They've turned your precious homeland into a madhouse, and only you can stop them! What's in it for you? Spectacular locations, battles with epic bosses and a nice mixture of pain and nonsense.\n\nChoose the right side of evil and rescue your \"princess\" - the most badass dare-deviless Hell has ever seen.\n\nThe game contains graphic violence, blood and gore.",

As a result, the Empire enters a period of urbanisation. New cities are built everywhere. This rural exodus leads to new towns in strategical places to ensure the growth of the Empire. A time of great change is also a right time for new discoveries and innovation in science. Cities are built around great monuments like gigantic zeppelin hangars and observatories.\"\n\nFeatures:\nA campaign mode containing 26 missions with 3 difficulty levels\nA sandbox mode for unlimited fun\nOver 24 different resources to manage\nMore than 40 different buildings and 4 unique Monuments\nOver fifteen different characters that roam the city\nMaps that reach up to 300 per 300 box tiles\nAn amazing soundtrack with over 20 different songs\n\nThis Nintendo Switch\u2122 version includes new features such as gamepad controls (and partly touch screen), new user interface to perfectly fit the Nintendo Switch\u2122 screen and a smoother difficulty curve!",

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout.\n\nIt's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. \n\nWhen the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.\n\nPlayable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.\n",

You can try to ramp up your score finding hidden collectibles in every level. Because it is at this time that you should have really fear of traffic.\n\nAt the start of the game the user will find himself in an extremely big map, free to be explored in each and every corner. At mid-screen, the player\u2019s car will be displayed. You will have to avoid pedestrians, cars and obstacles in order to not fail the level. In the top-left corner, the distance from the target can be found. Every level will have its own score, that will add up to every other level\u2019s. It is specifically designed for short but intense plays. The user is then challenged to repeat those levels with the goal of setting a new high score, maybe enjoying the company of other players competing against each other to earn the \u201cwinner\u201d title.",

        "description": "Juicy Realm is a roguelite game in which players must square off against bizarre fruits all across the world. The line between the animal and the plant world has become blurred, and the food chain has been completely disrupted. Humans, upon making this incredible discovery, have set up outposts along the border of the aggressive plants' habitat for investigations, defense, and in preparation for what may come. You take the role of a soldier on the front lines charged with confronting this strange new enemy.\n\n\"Many years in the future, humanity looks upward in despair at plants, now standing atop the food chain. How could they have been so arrogant...\"\nOnly when plants began sprouting arms and legs and developing self-awareness did humanity truly begin to understand the menace that these once photosynthesis-dependent creatures posed. No one could understand how the plants took this large evolutionary leap in such a short time, something that took their animal counterparts millions of years to accomplish. One thing is certain, now is the time for humanity to make their stand in order to stay at the top of the food chain.\n\nAs one of the first explorers of the newly discovered plant empire, you must continuously drive deeper and deeper into the enemy's lair. Defeat bizarre and colorful fruits while retrieving new gear, weapons, and resources to defend yourself and expand your base camp.\nIf you're unable to defeat the overwhelming destructive force of the plant army alone, invite a few friends to lend a hand and help you discover the secrets behind this strange new world.\n\nGame Features\n- Rougelite elements with random zones, treasures, and monsters\n- Loads of special weapons and items\n- Unique and incredibly detailed art style\n- Expand your camp and unlock new features\n- Solo campaign and local multiplayer",

Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn\u2019t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there\u2019s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.\u201d\n9/10 \u2013 Thunderbolt Games\n\n\u201cIt looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.\u201d\n4/5 \u2013 Touch Arcade",

        "description": "The evil black wizard has installed a clone on your throne and exiled you from the kingdom. Come, Exile. The time has come to take your kingdom back! \n\nOr challenge your friends in custom 2-player battles ranging from skirmish to all-out war.\n\nThe story:\n\n* Explore the land you once called home. And take it back.\n* Meet and recruit allies in your mission to take down the black wizard and his cohorts.\n* Capture windmills to generate the gold needed to fuel your war machine.\n\nBattles:\n\n* Real-time, fast-paced battles will test your mettle. Do not back down. No retreat!\n* Twelve unit and structure types, each with their unique uses and abilities.\n* Layer and diversify the warriors under your command and plan your attacks by exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of enemy troops, but plan quickly.\n* Support and upgrade your forces in battle by constructing their special building, turning simple soldiers into powerhouses on the battlefield.\n\nTactics:\n\n* Cast powerful spells to help turn the tide of war in your favor or summon mighty Giants to tear your enemies asunder. But be warned: your enemies have learned the ways of ancient magic, too!\n* Prefer subterfuge? Rogues and ninjas bypass the thick of the fighting and go straight after the enemy\u2019s infrastructure.\n* Learn from the computer AI by seeing its strategy play out in real-time. Improve your tactics, obtain victory, and reclaim the throne in the Final Battle!\n\nDifferent game modes:\n\n* Take back the kingdom in the classic Campaign game mode against the AI or challenge your friends in competitive one-on-one battles.\n* Tailor multiplayer fights to your desires with the settings and wage battle from skirmish to all-out war.\n* Two difficulty modes: Easy for a more casual experience and Normal to play how it was intended.\n\nSo, King, do you think you have what it takes to restore your kingdom, dispose of these traitors, and make your mark on destiny?\n",

As a High Priestess of Babylon, she believed she was invulnerable. When a sickness began to defile her body, she confronted her gods, realizing too late they were not the ones answering her prayers. \n \nJane Romero was striving to become a TV host, an inspiring voice for those in need.

One evening, driving home after a particularly stressful live show, she closed her eyes for a moment\u2026 and never made it home.\n",
