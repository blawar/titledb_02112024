Run and gun your way through thousands of adversaries as you explore the devastated research outpost, searching for survivors, and ultimately facing the origin of the outpost's demise.\n\nOutpost 88 is divided into seven distinct areas, each being randomly generated with each play, meaning that your strategy must evolve on the fly if you're to succeed in your mission. Collect dog-tags from vanquished enemies to upgrade your equipment between areas and look out for special weapons which will give you a momentary advantage.\n\n* A faithful port of the hit 16 bit game with added extras.\n\n* Incredible pixel art from the legendary pixel artist, Henk Nieborg.\n\n* Intense FM chiptune soundtrack by Savaged Regime, originally created for the YM2612!\n\n* Two difficulty levels and three modes of play.\n\n* An arsenal of 10 weapons to master.\n\n* Play solo or local co-op with a friend!",

Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!\n\nEverything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia\u2019s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot to mine the world\u2019s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.\n\nThe stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron\u2019s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron\u2019s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia\u2019s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she\u2019s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it\u2019s too late. \n\nOur hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Baron\u2019s Digsites before it\u2019s too late...\n\nKey Features\n\u2022\tStunning visuals - Intricate pixel art aesthetic inspired by retro classics\n\u2022\tExplore the world of Sparklite - Five beautiful, procedurally generated biomes\n\u2022\tInvent your arsenal - Invent gadgets to solve puzzles and defeat enemies\n\u2022\tBattle bosses - Take on the Baron Mining Corp and its formidable gremlin Titans\n\u2022\tMeet the locals - Befriend the people of Geodia and help build The Refuge\n\u2022\tHunt collectibles - Discover collectibles scattered throughout the world\n\u2022\tBuddy up! - Rescue Ada\u2019s robotic sidekick to play local assistive co-op with a friend",

Fight scary creatures, rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits, and weapons. Decide where to go next, whether it's upgrading this wrecked car, or rescuing that dog. Just remember, there are consequences for every action. Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Always keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet.\n- Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late.\n- Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new.\n- Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks.\n- A completely new end of the world from Finji (Canabalt, Night in the Woods).",

Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You\u2019ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!\n\nJason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!\n\nFans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including: \n\uf0a7\tFriday the 13th, Part II\n\uf0a7\tFriday the 13th, Part III\n\uf0a7\tFriday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives\n\uf0a7\tFriday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood\n\uf0a7\tFriday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\n\uf0a7\tJason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\n\nHow Will You Survive? \n\nThe entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. \n\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!\n\nPlay as the Counselors!\n\nWe all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!",

Solo: Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences. \n\nThe world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.\n\nAs with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island. \n\nNature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

        "description": "How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.\n\nUse camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.\n\nFeatures\n+ Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.\n+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.\n+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n\nGameplay\nOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.\n\nThis can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become. ",

        "description": "Life at the convent school isn't easy for Lilli. Only her vivid imagination lets the shy girl escape everyday-drudgery under the stern, watchful eye of the Mother Superior. She diligently works through her chores, no matter how unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any resentment, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable shell of sweetness.\nAnd if anything goes awry or gets ugly, the jolly censorship gnomes got her back: they put a nice coat of pink paint over all the things Lili would rather not consciously confront. But are her little potato-shaped budies real or just a figment of her vivid subconscious? Maybe it's only a matter of time until she completely loses her mind!\nWhen her best friend Edna disappears under mysterious circumstances, Lili bravely sets out on a dangerous journey, not only to get her friend back, but also to confront her subconscious fears.",

Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.\n\n\u2013 Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return. \n\n\u2013 Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.\n\n\u2013 As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.\n\n\u2013 Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.\n\n\u2013 Complex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.\n\n\u2013 All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!\n\n\u2013 Local Co-op. Complete missions together for better scores and more fun!",

Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents.\n\n\u2022 Recruit troops to strengthen your army\n\u2022 Command your forces to acquire new provinces\n\u2022 Challenge your friends all over the world\n\u2022 Sail across the seas & build castles to expand your empire\n\u2022 Eliminate enemy troops to weaken your adversaries\n\u2022 Collect goods to increase your advantage\n\nAWARDS & HONORS\nOur digital adaptation: \n\n\u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee\n\u2022 2017 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Nominee\n\nThe board game: \n\u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee\n\u2022 2013 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee\n\u2022 2014 Gioco dell\u2019Anno Nominee\n\u2022 2014 Hra roku Nominee\n\nEight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition features all additional content released to date: \n\u2022 Eight-Minute Empire base game\n\u2022 Mountains Expansion\n\u2022 Old Europe Map\n\u2022 Archipelago of Azra Map\n\u2022 Southern Plains Map\n\u2022 Starfall Crater Map\n\u2022 Isthmus of Gom Map\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 official Eight-Minute Empire game\n\u2022 great artwork\n\u2022 ingame interactive tutorial\n\u2022 languages: English, German, Dutch, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese Traditional and Simplified, Russian\n\u2022 play with AI, with friends or both\n\u2022 pass and play mode\n\u2022 online cross platform multiplayer with synchronous and asynchronous modes\n\u2022 opponents' last moves replay\n\u2022 3 levels of difficulty AIs with individual strategies\n\u2022 different maps\n\u2022 ambient sounds and music\n\u2022 official rules plus extra additions\n\u2022 unique, original board game feel on your Nintendo Switch\u2122\n\u2022 colorblind mode\n\u2022 over 70 achievements",

But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?",

        "description": "Risk versus reward guides your journey through the full-length single player campaign and local/online multiplayer. Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. A massive amount of lovingly-made environments, maps, modes, and abilities \u2013 all obsessively balanced \u2013 combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.\n\n\u2605 Single Player Campaigns\nChallenge yourself in the Hero\u2019s Journey: individually tailored hero campaigns filled with puzzle rooms, skill challenges, and boss fights. The unique abilities have entire journeys built specifically to teach you to properly use that hero\u2019s playstyle \u2013 all while the art of stealth and mastery of movement becomes second-nature.\n\n\u2605 Battle Online\nOnce you\u2019ve honed your skills in the Hero\u2019s Journey and defeated all of your friends, you\u2019ll want to challenge the world! Online matchmaking, crossplay with the PC community, and public or private matches with join keys allow you to find a foe anytime, anywhere.\n\n\u2605 Choose your Main\nWith 12 different heroes \u2013 each with their own unique ability \u2013 there is a perfect strategy for every playstyle. From meticulously sneaky to ruthlessly aggressive, find your favorite ability and shock your friends when you appear out of thin air and surprise them!\n\n\u2605 Competitive, Deep Hide and Seek\nCount your steps to find the perfect hiding spot, wait for your foes to reveal themselves, then pounce! While counterintuitive at first, invisibility becomes your most versatile tool, leading to intense moments of complete silence. Invisigun\u2019s core mechanics reward patience, forethought, trickery, and awareness.\n\n\u2605 Easy to Learn, Tough to Master\nThe depth is nearly unlimited with intentional baits, undetectable direction changes, powerup drops, and accidental bumps (that may not be so accidental). The chess dance is infinite and evolving, and all of the deceit is only heightened by the fact that your opponents could be lurking ANYWHERE!",

Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina\u2019s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.\n\n\nErina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.\n\nBoth Erina and Ribbon\u2019s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.\nWhat trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?\n\n\u25cfFeatures\n\n\u2013 Retro exploration platformer featuring a bunny girl.\n\u2013 4+n difficulty settings for all types of players.\n\u2013 9+ main areas and 20+ sub-areas to explore.\n\u2013 Bunny.\n\u2013 Over 60 items and upgrades.\n\u2013 Over 20 fully illustrated characters with cutscene illustrations.\n\u2013 40+ boss battles, 1000+ attack patterns with Boss Rush Mode to fight some or all of them in a row.\n\u2013 Post game story and content with speedrun mode which takes out every section of the game where the player cannot control the main character.\n\u2013 Over 50+ pieces from an original soundtrack.\n\u2013 English, Chinese and Japanese support.\n\u2013 Bunny.",

The game counts with a solid story which unfolds in a fantasy world populated by dozens of unorthodox characters. Adventuring, exploring ruins, accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world\u2026 you\u2019ve done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he\u2019s a bit fed up with the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he\u2019s in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that\u2019s not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement. Specially when you\u2019re trying to keep a dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one complex.\n\n-Explore a world of possibilities in a fully-realized fantasy realm. And one of those world map things we used to love.\n\n-Face huge bosses, dangerous foes, and angsty teenagers.\n\n-Find tons of parodies and pop culture references. Let's see if you can recognise them all.\n\n-Save the world. Sorta. Granted, it's a bit of a clich\u00e9. But hey, it works.\n\n-Unlock special abilities and upgrade basic combo movements with an all-powerful \u201cfinal blow\u201d-type move.\n\n-Evade the cruel and overrated real world with a long single player campaign. \n\n-Well, not as long as that one with the guy with the white hair, SURE, but we're an indie studio, dammit!",

        "description": "A stack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each side - green to approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?\n\nAfter work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech? \n\nOn the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs. \n\nBut every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash? \n\nAfter good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.

        "description": "After abandoning her high-powered tech career and a mysterious three-year absence, Evelyn Ishino-Aubrey resurfaces working as a proxy for a virtual counseling app called Eliza. Her job consists solely of reading a script provided to her in real-time by an AI, leaving her no autonomy over what she says. Is Eliza a technological marvel that brings therapy to those who otherwise couldn\u2019t access it? Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control over our lives and humanity?\n\nAs she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument\u2014 and as she begins to question everything about her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.\n\n\u2022 A thought-provoking story told in the form of a visual novel from an award-winning indie team.\n\n\u2022 Follow Evelyn\u2019s journey through a present-day Seattle brought to life with beautiful hand-painted art.\n\n\u2022 Get to know Eliza\u2019s clients and the employees of Skandha, the technology giant behind it, with over a dozen fully-voiced characters and powerful performances from a highly regarded cast.\n\n\u2022 An evocative, ambient original score by the composer for Infinifactory, SHENZHEN I/O, Opus Magnum, and EXAPUNKS.\n\n\u2022 Is AI-driven counseling better than nothing? Is it worse than nothing? What responsibilities come with technical skills? Consider your own answers to these questions and more.\n\n\u2022 Counseling sessions getting a little too real? Relax with Kabufuda Solitaire, a new take on solitaire using Japanese kabufuda cards.",

        "description": "As a new Manager, build a happy community and trade with other races... for profit. Yes, that's right, we need their happiness so we can power up our portals. The Lings, your workers, will obey you and help you with your village. But beware, they can cause a lot of problems too. If this is not enough, there are other creatures that will try to do the same, they can trade, fight or help you. Oh, don't forget about the weather and some unexpected events.\n\nVILLAGE BUILDING\n\nBuild your own village with many types of buildings, you need to decide what kind of objects, items or workbench you want inside. There are more than 150 items to craft. Every item and object has a reason. For example, craft a Wood Cabinet and put it inside the houses to increase your storage space. Roads can make them walk faster... and more.\n\nYOUR WORKERS\n\nThe Lings works for you. You need to provide basic salary, food, clothes and a \"\"healthy\"\" environment. It's up to you to decide how they work and where. Beware, they can start conflicts with each other and even set your village on fire. Watch them talk and keep your eyes open for their stats. Each one has unique traits and also attributes that you can control.\n\nDISCOVER\n\nSandbox maps with random generated nature based on your initial profile. Custom maps that you can build yourself. Talk, trade or fight with other races. Collect treasures and sell it or use it on your community. Random events that can turn your whole village into a nightmare from day to night. See how weather impacts your food and workers.\n\nAND MORE!\n\nRain and snow will change not only the visuals, but how you will handle your village. Craft better clothes or they can get sick. Craft better weapons and armors to face evil creatures or random thieves. Accept contracts and make enough Surplus (our currency) to make your community bigger. And, if everything goes wrong (or bad for you), you can just sell the village!\n\nWELCOME TO COMMUNITY INC!",

Bribe your way onto early departures, but don't let yourself go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping rough and begging for aid! Trade items for profit, and collect the equipment for the conditions you'll face: but too much luggage will slow you down...\n\n80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that never stops running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons, boats, camels, horses and more leave and arrive minute by minute. \n\nEvery city and journey is narrated via an interactive story where you control every action. Will your choices speed you up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your time? Murder, romance, rebellion and intrigue await! \n\n* \"We\u2019ve been dreaming about this future for decades. Guess what?

The question in this case appears simple enough:  was a security guard's death a suicidal plunge, or maybe an unfortunate fall? \nThe residents of the island - the Bradford family - at first seem cordial and beyond reproach, even shocked by the death of a friendly employee. But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that they harbor animosities and deep hidden motives. The more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations on it, the more complicated and unclear the matter becomes. A seemingly routine case turns into a tale of machinations driven by greed and a suicide investigation reveals multiple murders.\nIs anyone innocent?

        "description": "Welcome to the police department, where working late can lead to tragic consequences. You're John Bishop, a swamped-with-work detective who tirelessly carries out your investigations late into the night.

The security system has been hacked. All exits are locked. But that is not the real problem.\nSomeone\u2026 something is following you. Red eyes shine from dark corners and the sound of shifting, clanking metal echoes through the once safe halls.. You know them simply as animatronics, but something unknown and horrifying is driving them. Figure out what is going on, survive the night, and remember - no one will care if you scream.\n\nFEATURES:\n- A tablet to watch the security cameras carefully. You will use a tablet to watch the security cameras, and you need to be seriously careful. Using the environment of the police station is the key to salvation and survival. Be quiet, be alert, move fast. Your only tools, the only things you can rely on, are your legs, your tablet, and a torch.\n- Hide & Sneak. Use closets and cabinets to sneak between animatronics and try to catch a silent breath.\n- Animatronics. The steel legs and arms will treat you well. Get ready to be confused by their abilities. Be prepared to react to the unexpected.\n- Figure out what\u2019s happening. Explore the police department in search of explanations. Don\u2019t forget to listen to the world around you and keep track of the changes around. The only one that can save your life, is you.",

Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies, cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.\n \nYour mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures\u2026 and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.",

All you need is six minutes, two players, one Nintendo Switch\u2122, half a brain, and ample room for confusion.\n\nTalk It Out is a co-operative guessing game with a twist. Pick up your Nintendo Switch\u2122, grab a friend, and start \u201ctalking\u201d. You need to figure out what your co-player is seeing. Ask a question, get an answer. Simple enough, right?\n\nNot when your choice of questions is\u2026 less than co-operative. And the answers seem to make no sense. So choose wisely, and try to read between the lines. Because what is communication without interpretation? Bound to fail, that\u2019s what!\n\nWe should probably mention you\u2019re on a timer, too. No pressure.\n\nTalk It Out features:\nOdd questions and downright rude responses\nShort game rounds for quick coffee break fun\n2 additional unlockable item packs\n3 difficulty settings (because who wants to win ALL the time?)\n6 character choices that affect gameplay\nA chance to make new friends!\nTons of opportunity for misunderstanding and losing friends!\nA cat with underwear on its head for some reason\n",

        "description": "Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind Games.\n\nPsychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton\u2019s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary\u2019s true intentions, the dread begins.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nRemothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.\n\n- Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action, strategic, hide \u2018n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and his path. Don\u2019t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.\n\n- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.\n\n- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.\nAudio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.\n\n- No health bars - Your body is the only way to understand how you are doing.\n\n- Realistic puzzles - Environments and characters have been conceived to be realistic and credible.\n\n- Top-notch soundtrack - Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni wrote the music for the game.\n\n- Real-time loading - Explore the mansion without worrying about empty moments or boring loading times.\n\nIn addition, the Nintendo Switch\u2122 version of the game presents these extra features:\n\n- A free integrated Artbook that players will unlock the first time they finish the game. This Artbook will contain the characters, locations and storyboard sequences\u2019 concept art, collected items during the game, wireframes and 3D models of the mansion and characters.\n\n- Controller\u2019s vibration.\n\n- Spatialized audio.",

        "description": "A Duel Hand Disaster: Trackher was created in El Paso, Texas.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nNo cutscenes, just action. \n\nCAPITAL LIST LEADHERBOARDS - The primary goal is to get a high score, however the only way to keep your score is to extract with it. You cannot play till death. If you die, not only do you wipe your current score, you risk the chance of wiping your leaderboard position as well. How you ask? The lower your health the higher the bonus the greater the risk. Every time you extract your score is marked. Why you ask? Why not?\n\nSPLIT SCREEN SINGLE PLAYER TWIN STICK RISK \u2018EM UP - You will be controlling two ships simultaneously. The devil is in the details. The left side is invincible, however shooting and moving consumes your LINK. In order to restore it you must recover MATERIAL on the right side. MATERIAL multiplies your overall score so use it with absolute discretion. On the right side you are recovering resources and will need 12 PARTS to extract and mark your leaderboard position. Don\u2019t doubt yourself. Push yourself. You will be rewarded and you will be tested.\n\nTEARS - Each Tear consists of new challenges with hella bonuses attached to them. Focus, overcome, and survive.\n\nIf you want a challenge you came to the right place. Don\u2019t doubt what you are capable of. Get out of your comfort zone. Question everything.\n\nArcade Is Not Dead.",

You will have to build and manage cities, provide resources for your inhabitants while making sure there are enough workers to sustain your production lines. Trade with others cities, honor the requests of the Emperor and make your citizens happy.\n\nHistory:\nWith the discovery of condensed steam as a source of energy, the world of Lethis sees an unprecedented Industrial Revolution. As a result, the Empire enters a period of urbanisation. New cities are built everywhere. This rural exodus leads to new towns in strategical places to ensure the growth of the Empire. A time of great change is also a right time for new discoveries and innovation in science. Cities are built around great monuments like gigantic zeppelin hangars and observatories.\"\n\nFeatures:\nA campaign mode containing 26 missions with 3 difficulty levels\nA sandbox mode for unlimited fun\nOver 24 different resources to manage\nMore than 40 different buildings and 4 unique Monuments\nOver fifteen different characters that roam the city\nMaps that reach up to 300 per 300 box tiles\nAn amazing soundtrack with over 20 different songs\n\nThis Nintendo Switch\u2122 version includes new features such as gamepad controls (and partly touch screen), new user interface to perfectly fit the Nintendo Switch\u2122 screen and a smoother difficulty curve!",

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout.\n\nIt's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. \n\nWhen the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.\n\nPlayable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.\n",

Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn\u2019t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there\u2019s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.\u201d\n9/10 \u2013 Thunderbolt Games\n\n\u201cIt looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.\u201d\n4/5 \u2013 Touch Arcade\n\n",

The time has come to take your kingdom back! \n\nOr challenge your friends in custom 2-player battles ranging from skirmish to all-out war.\n\nThe story:\n\n* Explore the land you once called home. And take it back.\n* Meet and recruit allies in your mission to take down the black wizard and his cohorts.\n* Capture windmills to generate the gold needed to fuel your war machine.\n\nBattles:\n\n* Real-time, fast-paced battles will test your mettle. Do not back down. No retreat!\n* Twelve unit and structure types, each with their unique uses and abilities.\n* Layer and diversify the warriors under your command and plan your attacks by exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of enemy troops, but plan quickly.\n* Support and upgrade your forces in battle by constructing their special building, turning simple soldiers into powerhouses on the battlefield.\n\nTactics:\n\n* Cast powerful spells to help turn the tide of war in your favor or summon mighty Giants to tear your enemies asunder. But be warned: your enemies have learned the ways of ancient magic, too!\n* Prefer subterfuge? Rogues and ninjas bypass the thick of the fighting and go straight after the enemy\u2019s infrastructure.\n* Learn from the computer AI by seeing its strategy play out in real-time. Improve your tactics, obtain victory, and reclaim the throne in the Final Battle!\n\nDifferent game modes:\n\n* Take back the kingdom in the classic Campaign game mode against the AI or challenge your friends in competitive one-on-one battles.\n* Tailor multiplayer fights to your desires with the settings and wage battle from skirmish to all-out war.\n* Two difficulty modes: Easy for a more casual experience and Normal to play how it was intended.\n\nSo, King, do you think you have what it takes to restore your kingdom, dispose of these traitors, and make your mark on destiny?\n",

Wander through The Fog as Ash and escape evil once more.\n\nDuring a weekend at a cabin, Ash uncovered the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (Book of the Dead) and awoke something dark in the woods. Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars. But he screwed up one night when he read from the Necronomicon to impress a woman. Evil found him once more. After a terrible fight, Ash, drawing his last breath, was taken by the Knights of Sumeria and transported into the future. But after his deal with a demon went South, Ash found himself in the realm of the Entity, without shotgun or chainsaw.  \n",
