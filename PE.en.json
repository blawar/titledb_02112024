In this action-puzzle game, paper pals Snip and Clip must cut each other up to overcome tricky obstacles\u2026or just to laugh their heads off (sometimes literally). Partner up with friends or family to cut the heroes into the right shapes, interact with objects, and solve a world of imaginative puzzles. \n\nSomeone grab a paper weight\u2014these puzzles just won\u2019t stay still! The only limitation to solve puzzles is your imagination. Snip may need to cut Clip into a needle to pop balloons, or maybe they\u2019ll have to team up to form a squawking, egg-laying bird! \n\nWhen playing together, prove you\u2019re a cut above the rest in Blitz mode, where 2-4 players* can compete in a series of puzzlingly action-packed challenges. Three is never a crowd when you\u2019re paper thin, so make it a party! In Party mode, up to four players* can team up to solve tough challenges. Ready or not, this couch co-op is a riot, any way you cut it!",

For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the Nintendo Switch\u2122 system, and use any of the console\u2019s portable play styles for intense local multiplayer* action. Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!\n\nExpect a fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities. As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one dangerous part-time job! No matter which way you play, splat at home or on-the-go with Nintendo Switch. Staying fresh never felt so good.",

Increase your flip range, turn invincible, and more across 3 modes and 12 arenas! Compete alone or against up to 3 players to see who\u2019s best at each mode: flip the most panels before time runs up in Panel Battle, knock out the most opponents in Time Battle, or outlast your rivals in Life Battle. All 12 arenas have 4 layouts to choose from, some containing hazards like panel-flipping buttons, beam cannons, and waves so beautiful they truly stun competitors. Learn the art of the flip with tutorials and try your hand at achievements. When you\u2019re ready to compete, jump into an online* battle or a private room with friends via local wireless. No matter how you play, it\u2019s time to think fast and pull off the ultimate color scheme!",

        "description": "Jump into a new Yoshi adventure in a world made of everyday objects\u2014like boxes and paper cups! As Yoshi, you\u2019ll leap up high, gulp down enemies, and set out on a treasure hunt to find all the different collectables. On the flip side, stages can be played backwards, providing new perspectives to explore and new ways to locate some of the more craftily hidden items!\n\nIt all started when Kamek and Baby Bowser set out to steal a gem-set stone. Legend has it that this fabled artifact can grant the bearer their wildest dreams! But when the artifact\u2019s gems are sent flying, it falls upon Yoshi and friends to find them. Luckily, saving the day can be cooperative and challenging. Pass a Joy-Con\u2122 controller to a friend to team up as fellow Yoshis. Also, Mellow mode gives Yoshi wings for a breezier experience, which may come in handy! Finding all the flowers, coins, and Poochy Pups is no small feat! For extra protection, suit up in one of the handicraft costumes you can unlock in-game or by tapping select amiibo\u2122 figures!",

Begin your adventure as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer by choosing one of three new partner Pok\u00e9mon: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble. Then embark on a journey in the new Galar region, where you\u2019ll challenge the troublemakers of Team Yell, while unraveling the mystery behind the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a vast expanse of land where the player can freely control the camera. Team up with three other players locally or online in the new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles* in which players will face off against gigantic and super-strong Pok\u00e9mon known as Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nCertain Pok\u00e9mon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a powerful set of G-Max moves. But there\u2019s more to being a champion than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be the trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you\u2019ll encounter newly discovered Pok\u00e9mon as well as familiar ones that will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! For another way to level up your Pok\u00e9mon, assign them Pok\u00e9 Jobs to complete, and for fun, you can even play with your Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Camp! \n",

        "description": "A new generation of Pok\u00e9mon is coming to the Nintendo Switch\u2122 system. Begin your adventure as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer by choosing one of three new partner Pok\u00e9mon: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble. Then embark on a journey in the new Galar region, where you\u2019ll challenge the troublemakers of Team Yell, while unraveling the mystery behind the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a vast expanse of land where the player can freely control the camera. Team up with three other players locally or online in the new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles* in which players will face off against gigantic and super-strong Pok\u00e9mon known as Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon. \n\nCertain Pok\u00e9mon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a powerful set of G-Max moves. But there\u2019s more to being a champion than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be the trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you\u2019ll encounter newly discovered Pok\u00e9mon as well as familiar ones that will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! For another way to level up your Pok\u00e9mon, assign them Pok\u00e9 Jobs to complete, and for fun, you can even play with your Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Camp!  ",

        "description": "Command a capable crop of different types of Pikmin\u2122 to strategically overcome obstacles, defeat creatures, and find food for your famished home planet! You can even bring a second player along to divvy up tasks as you explore a world that seems larger than life from a pint-sized perspective. \n\nPikmin at your pace \n\nReturn to your ship before time runs out, or you (and your Pikmin) could be in big trouble. If you prefer a more casual approach, a variety of difficulty settings, lock-on targeting and optional hints have been newly added. With less pressure, you have more time to strategically command your Pikmin and take in the lush scenery. \n\nPlay side-story missions, head-to-head matches and more! \n\nThis deluxe version of the Pikmin 3 game includes new side-story missions featuring Olimar and Louie, the ability to play Story mode with a friend and all DLC stages from the original release. Feeling competitive? Enjoy fierce head-to-head Bingo Battles against another player!\n\n\nThree brave explorers land on planet PNF-404 on a mission to find food for their starving home planet. After a crash landing, these explorers must work with Pikmin to reunite and complete their mission. \n\nDirect, toss and grow Pikmin with different abilities and strengths\u2014winged Pikmin can fly, while blue Pikmin can breathe underwater. By strategically choosing the right Pikmin for the job at hand and changing between the three captains (or coordinating with a second player), you can work efficiently to collect fruit and grow your Pikmin squad. \n\nWhen you aren\u2019t busy collecting fruit and saving your planet, try out Mission mode to accomplish set requirements like defeating enemies or collecting items. You can also compare your Mission mode scores with the rest of the world via online leaderboards*. Looking for some friendly competition? In Bingo Battle you must use Pikmin to retrieve items on your bingo card before your opponent does. \n\nWith more options for cooperative play, settings that make it easy for newcomers to start their Pikmin journey, new side stories and more, these tiny Pikmin are in for their biggest adventure yet.\n\nDownload the Nintendo eShop demo to sample Story mode, Mission mode, and even explore together with a second player! Your progress will even transfer to the full game, once purchased. As an added bonus, defeating the first boss in the demo and transferring save-data to the full version of the game will immediately unlock the \u201cUltra-Spicy\u201d difficulty option for the full game. \n",

Fight scary creatures, rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits, and weapons. Decide where to go next, whether it's upgrading this wrecked car, or rescuing that dog. Just remember, there are consequences for every action. Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Always keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet.\n- Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late.\n- Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new.\n- Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks.\n- A completely new end of the world from Finji (Canabalt, Night in the Woods).",

Defend yourself from Malos and his forces using all the fury of this refined battle system, allowing you to fight as both the artificial lifeforms known as Blades and their masters, the Drivers.\n\nDrivers and their Blades can change from the frontlines of combat to the back in order to unleash powerful context-sensitive abilities. Together, you\u2019ll fight for the survival of mankind, under threat by Malos, who wields the legendary sword, The Monado. To stand a chance, you must master every character\u2019s powerful skills including Talent Arts, a strategic element returning from the original Xenoblade Chronicles\u2122 game. By equipping Drivers with new weapons, you can alter their attacks and elemental powers to perform devastating combos. On the long road ahead, you\u2019ll rest at camps, cook food, craft items, and share a heart-to-heart with many a traveling companion. Who knows where this twisted journey will lead.\n",

The game spans various areas across the globe starring multiple playable characters, including fan favorites and new faces.\n\nJump into the fray either solo or in 2-player co-op in 4 dramatic chapters of the campaign. Some missions even feature additional random matchmaking with other players for unique 4-player co-op crossover boss battles. For more multiplayer action, head into one of the extra modes such as Survivor - which pits up to 6-players head-to-head in a heated battle.\n\nThis edition includes all DLC, along with two costumes per main character that were originally Residentevil.net exclusives, but are now unlockable through the game itself.",

        "description": "Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.\n\nThe challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.\n\nWhat\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.\n\nThey don\u2019t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\u2019ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\u2019t happen but marketing text is hard to write.\n",

Fight your way to the final boss and escape or continue your run indefinitely to see just how long you can survive. A unique scaling system means both you and your foes limitlessly increase in power over the course of a game.\n\nDISCOVER POWERFUL NEW ITEMS\nMore than 110 items keep each run fresh and full of new challenge. The more items you collect, the more their effects combine, the more surprising some of those combinations might be. The more items you encounter, the more lore (and strategy) you\u2019ll discover through the logs.\n\nUNLOCK NEW WAYS TO PLAY \nUnlock a crew of ten playable survivors, each with their own unique combat style and alternate skills to master. Learn the secrets of the Artifacts to toggle gameplay modifiers like friendly fire, random survivor spawns, item selection and more. With randomized stages, enemies, and items, no run will ever be the same.\n\nPLAY SOLO OR CO-OP\nTackle the adventure solo or with up to three friends in online co-op, or compete in the rotating challenge of the Prismatic Trials. Brand new survivors like the Captain and MUL-T join classic survivors such as the Engineer, Huntress, and--of course--the Commando.\n",

It\u2019s fun to see these classic worlds reimagined in retro style, meshing perfectly with the main game\u2019s 2D mode. Like all past DRAGON QUEST games, this one\u2019s character designs are based on the signature style of famed artist Akira Toriyama. Paired with the voiced dialogue, the rich personalities of your most loyal companions and fiercest enemies are brought to life, so you can fully immerse yourself in this quest to discover the Luminary\u2019s true heritage and awaken your power.

        "description": "STONE THE CROWS! Are you ready to explore the wilds of the Australian Outback in this remastered version of the classic game, TY the Tasmanian Tiger?\n\nJoin TY on a RIPPER of an adventure to free his family from the DREAMING and stop the nefarious evil genius BOSS CASS from removing mammals from the top of the food chain. \n\nTo help you on your quest, you've got a BEAUT arsenal of boomerangs, sharp teeth, and the help of a few friends!\n\nSo don\u2019t be a galah - let's head down under, and have a CORKER of a time! BEAUTY, BOTTLER, BONZA!\n\n* Explore 17 levels of the Australian Outback in their old-school 3D platforming glory\n* 13 different boomerangs including the Frostyrang, Flamerang and powerful Doomerang\n* Improved graphics; including updated shadows, reflections, HD resolutions and 60fps\n* New Gamemode called \"Hardcore Mode\"\n* New TY character skins\n* Audio Director's cut\n\n* * * * *\n\nG'day mate! Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.\n\nBut then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!\n\nYou see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!\n\nNow, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!\n\nDon't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!",

These Pok\u00e9mon normally can\u2019t be encountered until later in the game!\n\nMax Raid Battles are battles in which you can recruit up to three players** via local communication or the internet to face down powerful Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon!\n\nEvery participant will get an opportunity to catch the Pok\u00e9mon if you triumph in the battle! Additionally, with Dynamax Crystals, you\u2019ll be able to attempt these Max Raid Battles as many times as it takes to win or until midnight on the day that the Dynamax Crystal was used, whichever comes first.*\n\n\u25a0The Galar Region Awaits You!\nBegin your adventure as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer by choosing one of three new partner Pok\u00e9mon: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble.

        "description": "Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features:\n\u2022\tThe player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\n\u2022\tYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon. \n\n\u2022\tLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\n\u2022\tExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony\u2019s two planets didn\u2019t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon. \n",

        "description": "The kingdom has been ravaged by an origami menace! Join Mario and his new partner, Olivia, as they battle evil Folded Soldiers, repair the damaged landscape, and try to free Princess Peach\u2019s castle from the clutches of King Olly in this comedy-filled adventure, only on the Nintendo Switch\u2122 system.\n\nMaster strategic, ring-based battles\n\nLine up scattered enemies and plan your attack to maximize damage with the new, ring-based battle system that requires both puzzle-solving skills and a quick wit.\n\nMario and Luigi receive an invitation from Princess Peach to attend an origami festival and excitedly hurry to Toad Town\u2026but something\u2019s amiss. After investigating the eerily empty town, the duo finds a fearsome (and folded) Princess Peach\u2014she\u2019s been turned into origami by King Olly, ruler of the Origami Kingdom! With five giant streamers under his control, King Olly binds Princess Peach\u2019s Castle and transports it to a distant mountain as part of his plan to re-fold the world.\n\nOn his journey to liberate Peach\u2019s Castle and repair the ravaged paper landscape, Mario meets Olivia, King Olly\u2019s sister, and the two join forces to put a stop to Olly\u2019s origami onslaught. Even Bowser falls victim to Olly\u2019s plot when his minions are turned into origami Folded Soldiers and betray their Koopa king, forcing him to ally with Mario and Olivia!\n\nBattle the Folded Soldiers in ring-based battles that challenge you to strategically line up enemies to maximize damage! Out of battle, Mario can use the arm-extending 1,000-Fold Arms ability in specific spots to interact with the landscape to pull, peel, hit, and more! Join Mario, Olivia, and their companions on a journey of laughter and emotion, thrills, and a whole lot of folding.\n",

        "intro": "Descend into the depths of an alien underwater world filled with wonder and peril.",
        "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\n\nDive Into a Vast Underwater World\n\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\n\nScavenge, Craft, and Survive\n\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear, and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\n\nConstruct Underwater Habitats\n\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\n\nUnravel the Mystery\n\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\n\nDisrupt the Food Chain\n\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\n\nHandle the Pressure\n\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\n\nFear the Night\n\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\n\nDive Below the Ocean Floor\n\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.",

        "description": "Below Zero is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean world. It is a new chapter in the Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds.\n\nReturn to planet 4546B\n\nSubmerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to investigate what happened to your sister...\n\nUncover the Truth\n\nAlterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and databanks scattered among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own.\n\nDiscover Uncharted Biomes\n\nSwim beneath the blue-lit, arching expanses of Twisty Bridges. Become mesmerized by the glittering, mammoth crystals of the Crystal Caverns. Clamber up snow covered peaks and venture into the icy caves of Glacial Basin. Maneuver between erupting Thermal Vents to discover ancient alien artifacts. Below Zero presents entirely new environments for you to survive, study, and explore.\n\nConstruct Habitats and Vehicles\n\nSurvive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast across the snowy tundra on a Snowfox hoverbike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Seatruck.\n\nResearch Alien Lifeforms\n\nSomething undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Holefish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan, and visit the adorable Pengwings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.\n\nSurvive the Chilly Temperatures\n\nJump in, the water\u2019s warm. The below zero temperatures of this arctic region pose a new threat. New weather conditions blanket above-ground habitats. Craft a toasty cold suit, sip on piping hot coffee, and warm up next to Thermal Lilies to stave off the chill. \n\nAn ocean of intrigue\n\nWhat really happened to your sister? Who were the aliens who came here before? Why were they on this planet? Can we find solace from grief in truth? Below Zero extends the story of the Subnautica universe, diving deep into the mystery introduced in the original game.",

Meet Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, and many more, and choose from their dozens of powerful Boons that enhance your abilities. There are thousands of viable character builds to discover as you go.\n\nBEFRIEND GODS, GHOSTS, AND MONSTERS\nA fully-voiced cast of colorful, larger-than-life characters is waiting to meet you! Grow your relationships with them, and experience thousands of unique story events as you learn about what's really at stake for this big, dysfunctional family.\n\nBUILT FOR REPLAYABILITY\nNew surprises await each time you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld, whose guardian bosses will remember you. Use the powerful Mirror of Night to grow permanently stronger, and give yourself a leg up the next time you run away from home.\n\nNOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE\nPermanent upgrades mean you don't have to be a god yourself to experience the exciting combat and gripping story.

From a simple game of tag to a run-and-jump obstacle course, each lesson is broken down into multiple, manageable segments that let kids go at their own pace\u2014and have fun in the process.\n\nLearn the basics of visual game programming \n\nBy playing through interactive lessons, kids will learn the basics of visual game programming. Nodon, colorful creatures with distinct personalities, keep kids engaged through lessons with tips and motivating messages. With a simple press of a button, swap between the programming screen and the game screen\u2014watch how programming changes the game on the fly.\n\nTrack progress and build confidence\n\nAfter completing each lesson and building a game, kids will test their knowledge by completing Checkpoints\u2014small puzzles or tasks to solve with programming. Master these skills and head to Free Programming mode to let your imagination (and programming chops) run wild.\n\nThe Nodon you meet each have distinct personalities that complement their functions. Have fun connecting them together to see how they interact and bring your game to life. The in-game Nodopedia lets you quickly check what each Nodon does as you create. There\u2019s also a guide that recaps important skills! Easily swap between the Programming and Game screens to see the hard-working Nodon in action.\n\nTake advantage of the Nintendo Switch system\u2019s many features. Instead of the control stick, program motion controls to control your game. Want to create some competition? Add in a multiplayer function and pass a Joy-Con\u2122 controller to a friend. It\u2019s up to you (and your Nodon friends) to decide what type of game you want to make.\n\nLooking for inspiration? Exchange codes and download* games from friends. You can even go into Free Programming mode to look at those downloaded games\u2019 programming and put your own twist on it.

Frosting meets flowers as you race to get the most stars (and sabotage your opponents) on the Peach\u2019s Birthday Cake board from the original Mario Party game. Or watch the countdown that unleashes Bowser Coin Beam and hold onto those coins on the Space Land board. The tides can turn quickly in Mario Party, so stay vigilant, partygoers. This and all other modes can be played online*, too!\n\n100 classic minigames return from the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube\u2122 games and more!\n\nTry your hand at a Superstar collection of minigames from throughout the Mario Party series. Whether you are saving up coins for stars in board game mode or practicing in free play, there is nothing quite like being the last one standing in Mushroom Mix-Up or Shy Guy Says. All minigames are played with button controls, so you can stick to the Joy-Con\u2122 controller or bust out the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller or a Nintendo Switch Lite system.\n\nParty with superstars near or far\n\nBring the party anytime, anywhere with same-system**, local wireless**, or online* play. Matches with friends in board game mode save each turn, so feel free to take a break and pick up where you left off. Use stickers to praise or pester fellow players as you race across the board collecting stars. All modes support online multiplayer, so you can hop in with friends for a few minigames or a marathon 30-turn match. Victory is just as sweet (and stealing stars is just as satisfying) from anywhere across the globe.",

Andy can repair units, while Sami can boost the abilities of troops. Your opponents can use CO abilities of their own too! Throughout both campaigns, the COs you meet play a critical role both on the battlefield and in the story.\n\nRecruit some friends and see who the superior strategist is\n\nWhen you aren\u2019t busy keeping the peace in one of the two campaign stories, flex your army-commanding chops in Versus Mode*.

Travel Medallion\n5. 8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n6. Korok Mask\n\nFurther information about the content can be found below: \n\n1. Trial of the Sword\n\nVisit a certain location to challenge the Trial of the Sword, where you must vanquish waves of enemies to progress from one room to the next. You will start this challenge completely bare, without any armor, equipment, or food items to aid you. Once you defeat all the enemies in a room, you can advance to the next. If you complete all 45 rooms, Link's mind and body will be strong enough to wield the Master Sword's full power and splendor any time the sword is usable! \n\n2. Hero's Path Mode\n\nA feature that allows you to view the path you've taken on your journey. It will record your journey for up to 200 hours of gameplay. Use this to find those shrines and Koroks that are still eluding you! You can even adjust the replay speed so you can manually select the pace you wish to watch your path unfold.\n\n3. Master Mode\n\nIn Master Mode, most enemies you encounter will be one tier higher than they originally were. For example, where you would normally see red Bokoblins, you will now likely see Blue Bokoblins instead.\n\nThere is also a new top tier of enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode! Additionally, enemies will recover health if you stop attacking them, and they will also notice Link more easily, so you may need to make adjustments to your fighting strategies. You also might find enemies and treasure chests floating in the air! Use these locations to your advantage to score treasure or even recover stamina.\n\n4. Travel Medallion\n\nThere is an item called the Travel Medallion hidden in a treasure chest somewhere. Place it at your current location and you will be able to travel there whenever you please. You can only register one location at a time, but this addition should aid you in your journey.\n\n5. 8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series (Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor, and Phantom Greaves) will be hidden in 8 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule. There are hints to help you find these items hidden somewhere as well. Search for these hints and treasures while you journey across Hyrule!\n\n6. Korok Mask\n\nThe Korok Mask is an item that will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere in Hyrule, and unlike the 8 items mentioned above, this one has a special ability. When Link wears this mask, it will shake when a hidden Korok is nearby!",

Once all challenges and trials have been bested, Link will obtain a new power known as the Master Cycle Zero!\n\nAdditionally, the bard Kass is traveling Hyrule to complete the unfinished song his teacher left behind. As Link and Kass chase their respective goals, Kass will share new original songs he wrote capturing lost memories of the four Champions and Zelda, previously unknown to Link. But that unfinished song... What could it be? \n\n*To play The Champions' Ballad, you must first complete the Main Quest to free the four Divine Beasts. \n\n2. 9 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series will be hidden in 9 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule, including the Island Lobster Shirt, Ravio's Hood, Zant's Helmet, Phantom Ganon Skull, Phantom Ganon Armor, Phantom Ganon Greaves, and a Royal Guard outfit (complete with Royal Guard Cap, Royal Guard Uniform, and Royal Guard Boots).\n\n3. Ancient Horse Gear\n\nThe Ancient Bridle will increase a horse's number of spurs while equipped. The Ancient Saddle will allow you to call your horse no matter how far away they are. Both of these items will appear in treasure chests somewhere in Hyrule.",

        "intro": "Build Your Greatest Empire on Nintendo Switch\u2122",
        "description": "Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI Expansion Bundle, which combines both Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, takes the turn-based strategy classic to new heights. With 16 new civilizations, 18 new leaders, and major enhancements to gameplay such as Great Ages and an active planet where geology and climatology present unique new challenges, the pursuit of building the greatest empire becomes as exciting as it has ever been in the Civilization franchise.\n\nThe Civilization VI Expansion Bundle contains all features from the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, that includes: \n\n\u2022NEW LEADERS AND CIVS: Combined together, sixteen new civilizations and eighteen new leaders are introduced. Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as unique units, districts, wonders, buildings, and more. \n\n\u2022GREAT AGES: As your civilization ebbs and flows and you reach milestone Historic Moments, you will move towards Dark Ages or Golden Ages, each providing specific challenges or bonuses based on your actions in game. Rise triumphantly from a Dark Age, and your next Golden Age will be even stronger \u2013 a Heroic Age.\n\n\u2022LOYALTY: Cities now have individual Loyalty to your leadership \u2013 let it fall too low, and face the consequences of low yields, revolts, and the potential to lose your city if it declares its own independence. But one civilization\u2019s loss can be your gain as you inspire Loyalty among cities throughout the map and further expand your borders.\n\n\u2022GOVERNORS: Recruit, appoint, and upgrade powerful characters with unique specialization bonuses and promotion trees to customize your cities, and reinforce Loyalty.\n\n\u2022ENHANCED ALLIANCES: An enhanced alliances system allows players to form different types of alliances and build bonuses over time.\n\n\u2022EMERGENCIES: When a civilization grows too powerful, other civilizations can join a pact against the threatening civilization, and earn rewards, or penalties, when the Emergency ends.\n\n\u2022TIMELINE: Review your civilization\u2019s history at any time with the new Timeline feature, a visual journey through the Historic Moments that you encountered on your path to victory. \n\n\u2022ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sandstorms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts bring the world to life in a brand-new way. Your settlement choices are more important than ever as you balance high risks and high rewards. \n\n\u2022POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES: Strategic resources play an additional role. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you\u2019ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world\u2019s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. \n\n\u2022ENGINEERING PROJECTS: Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles.\n\n\u2022WORLD CONGRESS: Make your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory. \n\n\u202221st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES & CIVICS: A new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions.",

With his Masamune blade in hand and destruction on his mind, Sephiroth is a force to be reckoned with.\n",

Kazuya\u2019s fighting style captures the distinct style of the Tekken series as he gets up close and personal with heavy strikes and incredible comeback power. His specials tap into his Devil Gene with moves like the beam-shooting Devil Blaster and high-flying Devil Wings. The son of Tekken icon Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya has a chip on his shoulder and destructive power.\n\nWhat makes Kazuya Mishima unique in this game are his standard attacks\u2014rather than 4 directional standard attacks, he has 8. This addition of diagonal inputs mimics his abilities in the Tekken games and make him an unpredictable fighter with a lot of combo options. The stage added with this fighter is the Mishima Dojo, which starts out with all four directions closed off. A strong launch or direct attack can shatter the walls and ceilings, allowing for opponents to get KO\u2019d. \n\nTekken rated TEEN by the ESRB. \n\n",

That's Tooki's motto. Always taking on new recruits under her wing, Tooki brings the team to new heights. Just be careful when she invites you out to lunch; her bill is always enormous!\n\nCoco: Coco is one tough nut to crack. Raised in a family of fifty noisy brothers, he enjoys a quiet evening alone on the beach with nothing but his thoughts and stamp collection. But get Coco talking about tropical furniture and he'll open right up!\n\nGilly: There are plenty of fish in the sea, but none are quite as bubbly as Gilly! Born into royalty, she escaped her family's sandcastle to live out her dreams as a furniture mover. Well, that's what she tells everyone around the water cooler. Though the tale does sound a bit fishy...\n\nClawdius: This busy little administrator loves filling out paperwork and signing forms, but when there's boxes to move in a pinch, Clawdius will scuttle right to the forefront! You can find him at night naming all the constellations.\n\nSo buckle up, slap on some sunscreen and sail on over to Packmore Island for Movers in Paradise!",

Trial of the Sword\nVisit a certain location to challenge the Trial of the Sword, where you must vanquish waves of enemies to progress from one room to the next. You will start this challenge without any armor, equipment, or food items to aid you. If you complete all 45 rooms, Link's mind and body will be strong enough to wield the Master Sword's full power and splendor any time the sword is usable! \n\n2. Hero's Path Mode\nView the path you've taken on your journey. It will record your journey for up to 200 hours of gameplay. Use this feature to find shrines and Koroks! You can even manually adjust the replay speed.\n\n3. Master Mode\nIn Master Mode, most enemies you encounter will be one tier higher than they originally were. There is also a new top tier of enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode! Additionally, enemies will recover health if you stop attacking them, and they will also notice Link more easily. You also might find enemies and treasure chests floating in the air!\n\n4. Travel Medallion\nThe Travel Medallion will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere. Place it at your current location and you will be able to travel there whenever you please. You can only register one location at a time, but this addition should aid you in your journey.\n\n5. 8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series (Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor, and Phantom Greaves) will be hidden in 8 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule. There are hints to help you find these items hidden somewhere as well. Search for these hints and treasures while you journey across Hyrule!\n\n6. Korok Mask\nThe Korok Mask is an item that will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere in Hyrule, and unlike the 8 items mentioned above, this one has a special ability. When Link wears this mask, it will shake when a hidden Korok is nearby!\n\nDLC Pack 2: The Champions' Ballad will include the following:\n\n1.\u3000The Champions' Ballad\nA mysterious voice beckons Link to challenge the Divine Beast Tamer's Trials. He must now prove himself by defeating enemies using the One-Hit Obliterator, conquering new Shrines, challenging a full dungeon, and overcoming many trials along the way. Once all challenges and trials have been bested, Link will obtain a new power known as the Master Cycle Zero!\n\nAdditionally, the bard Kass is traveling Hyrule to complete the unfinished song his teacher left behind. As Link and Kass chase their respective goals, Kass will share new original songs he wrote capturing lost memories of the four Champions and Zelda, previously unknown to Link. But that unfinished song... What could it be? \n\n*To play The Champions' Ballad, you must first complete the Main Quest to free the four Divine Beasts. \n\n2.\u30009 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series will be hidden in 9 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule, including the Island Lobster Shirt, Ravio's Hood, Zant's Helmet, Phantom Ganon Skull, Phantom Ganon Armor, Phantom Ganon Greaves, and a Royal Guard outfit (complete with Royal Guard Cap, Royal Guard Uniform, and Royal Guard Boots).\n\n3.\u3000Ancient Horse Gear\nThe Ancient Bridle will increase a horse's number of spurs while equipped. The Ancient Saddle will allow you to call your horse no matter how far away they are. Both of these items will appear in treasure chests somewhere in Hyrule.",
