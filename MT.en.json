This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

        "intro": "Banging beats and mad style, Lethal League Blaze is the most intense ball game you can play online with up to 4 players.",
        "description": "Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. \n\nIn the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!\n\nUp to 4 players:\nPlay locally AND online with up to 4 players.\n\nEasy to pick up, hard to master gameplay:\nStart off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. \n\nTons of unlockable extras and secrets:\nUnlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. \n\nPlay on your own:\nStep up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.\n\nModes and options:\nPick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... \n\nWicked Tracks:\nA Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.\n\nLethal League Blaze is the sequel to the popular projectile-fighting game Lethal League known for it's ridiculous speeds and hitstun, the original game was intense to watch and intenser to play. This time around there will be double the characters at launch and more to come after.",

BREAK A NECK\nDiscover the joys of being old and made of glass, anything can break you and you can break your everything. \n\nDON\u2019T TRY THIS AT (RETIREMENT) HOME\nComplete dangerous challenges that you will never ever try at home and answer existential questions like: can you launch yourself from a catapult and land on someone? Or, can you survive losing your head, grabbing it and whacking someone with it?\n\nONE MISSION: RETIRE!\nEarn rewards by completing dangerous challenges, your goal? To qualify for a proper retirement home. That makes perfect sense. Word of advice: try and stay in one piece so you can enjoy it in the end\u2026\n\nSANDBOX MULTIPLAYER\nPlay alone, or with up to 4 players in online multiplayer.

So good we said it twice.\n\nLIMITLESS INTERACTION\nPick up and interact with a very wide variety of objects. Everything from giant trouts, trampolines, guns, electrical wiring, and fireworks, just to mention a few. Bazookas, axes, trombones, air horns and jetpacks to mention a few more. Yes they all can be used to hurt and maim.\n\nEMBRACE YOUR INNER BOOMER\nWreak havoc on the millennial and zoomer population (we forgot Generation X, just like everyone else). NPCs react differently depending on their age - some will laugh and clap at others getting hurt while others will run away in terror. \n\nTHE GAME CAN BE AS CRAZY AS YOU\nThe city is filled with detailed environments, loaded with secrets and hidden paths, that encourage detailed exploration and quirky experimentation to truly see it all.\n\nOLD. PERSON.\nOkay that\u2019s the last time we promise.",

After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they\u2019d ever seen before.\n\nHowever, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she\u2019s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can\u2019t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.\n\nWhile Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she\u2019s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail\u2019s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves.",

Backstab, slash and smash bones in melee or tear the enemy apart with rockets and grenades. Attack from above with a jetpack, spraying lead rain or request an orbital supply drop to trigger a new fight over it\u2019s content. \n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Massive and dense PvP battles: dozens of players begin their trip in one of the four picturesque and detailed locations, fighting their way to the centre of the battlefield. All the while, the battlefield itself shrinks constantly, surrounded by the deadly Dark Zone. \n\n\u2022  Seven different champions to select - each one with a unique superpower. \n\n\u2022 A constantly growing collection of realistically modelled weapons and armor, including anti-materiel guns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and mortars. There are few compromises in the game regarding physics or ballistics rules. Different vehicles, military amphibians and speed boats will help to cover distances. \n\n\u2022 There are mystical powers in game! Draw seals with your blood or conduct ancient rituals, throw hex bags at enemies and use your own special power. You can flood the whole map or cause the sun to eclipse, set up traps, summon zombies or teleport yourself or others the hell out of here. But first, one needs to collect sinner souls for killing enemies - to be able to pay for most of that luxury. \n\n\u2022 Stand out from the crowd with different costumes, masks, talismans, hats, gestures, graffiti and even underwear! Unlock new spirit-guardians to get additional tactical abilities in the battles. \n\n\u2022 There are regular special events in the game with new rules and setups of battles and a system of daily tasks and secret missions rewarding players with unique items and powers. \n\n\u2022 Fair play TPV: you can play in first or third person view. In order to mitigate any advantage of the latter, every player has a familiar with a camera that can uncover the position of a player who is peeking around a corner. So if you see a butterfly or a drone - you should know that you are being watched.\n\n\u2022 New content is added frequently!",

As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features:\n\n\u2022 The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\n\u2022 You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon. \n\n\u2022 Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\n\u2022 Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony\u2019s two planets didn\u2019t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon. \n",

        "description": "Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunt is a first-person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous beasts to ever exist \u2013 DINOSAURS.\nThis game is a remaster of the classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, delivered with a new game engine, improved graphics, advanced dinosaur behaviors, and seamless player progression.\nExperience an out of this world hunting experience, as you track down and stalk dinosaurs! To survive you'll need to know your target\u2019s temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings, because you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end up being lunch.\nOn your hunting adventure, you will visit beautiful but dangerous environments, each with their own unique Ecosystems. Explore the pristine beaches, dense jungles, rocky plains, and scorching deserts of planet FMM UV-32. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. You can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth tactics or gaining the high ground will give you an edge over the more vicious dinosaurs roaming the planet.\nCareful planning and consideration must be taken before every hunt including weapon choice. Will you use a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, or a silent crossbow? Maybe bring along a sidearm just in case. One of the most important items you will need is your handheld M.I.S.T. (Mobile Interstellar Satellite Transponder), which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking these beasts easier. There are other items you can bring on your hunt to improve your chances of survival such as Cover Scent, which masks your smell.\nYou will track down a wide range of dinosaurs, each species with their own behavior patterns and intelligence levels - everything from \"pea-brained\" dummies to cunning apex predators, with heightened senses of sight, hearing, and smell. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species, each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, others will attack because they feel threatened, and the rest will kill anything that moves! So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted.\n\nKey Features:\n \u2022 Hunt down planet FMM UV-32\u2019s most dangerous creatures \u2013 the Dinosaurs!\n \u2022 A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivores (plant eaters) to the Carnivores (meat eaters).\n \u2022 Realistic AI \u2013 Dinosaurs react to sight, sound, and smell \u2013 with differing reactions and characteristics.\n \u2022 Explore and hunt throughout all of planet FMM UV-32\u2019s vast Ecosystems\n \u2022 Equip things like camouflage and Cover Scent to outsmart the dinosaurs.\n \u2022 A diverse range of weapons and equipment to hunt with.\n \u2022 Interactive Dinosaur Trophy Room.\n \u2022 Leaderboards including most money earned, high scores and max distance shots for every type of dinosaur.",

        "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\n\nDive Into a Vast Underwater World\n\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\n\nScavenge, Craft, and Survive\n\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear, and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\n\nConstruct Underwater Habitats\n\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\n\nUnravel the Mystery\n\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\n\nDisrupt the Food Chain\n\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\n\nHandle the Pressure\n\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\n\nFear the Night\n\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\n\nDive Below the Ocean Floor\n\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.",

Ryza, the only member of her group to remain on the island, receives a letter from her friend telling her about ruins that may be related to alchemy, along with a mysterious request involving a glowing stone. This inspires her to leave the island and venture out to the royal capital, Ashra-am Baird. However, Ryza is unaware that this will lead to the beginning of an imaginative new adventure involving a pursuit of the mysteries of the ruins surrounding the royal capital and a meeting with a strange creature that will change her life.\n\n\u300aMain Features\u300b\n\u25a0 Exploring with new field actions!\nRyza can now perform many new actions in the field, including diving underwater, using plants to climb walls, moving through narrow gaps, and using magic ropes to travel between separated areas. These and other abilities allow Ryza to explore various areas and ruins more fully and actively.\n\u25a0 More action-filled real-time battles!\nTake on your enemies using an improved \u201creal-time tactics\u201d battle system, which is now faster and more thrilling than ever. Speedily switch between characters, choose varied skills, and utilize items in just the right moments for best results.\n\u25a0 Straightforward and easy-to-use synthesis!\nUtilize several new synthesis systems, including the new intuitive \u201cLinkage Synthesis\u201d system where items are placed in cells called \u201cMaterial Loops\u201d, that are designed to allow both new players to easily learn synthesis, and experienced players to create unique customized items. Created items can also be mixed and matched with \u201cEvolution Link\u201d to create entirely new items.",

Their only weakness, and yours, is sunlight, which means there's only one way to stop them: call them out on the streets, knock their clothes off, and expose their skin before they can do it to you.\n\nArm yourself with a rolled-up poster, a guitar, a laptop, a magical girl wand, or (if you insist) an actual weapon, then hit Akihabara's colourful streets. Browse recreations of real-life shops circa 2011, mingle with Akiba's residents and tourists, and discover the town's many secrets.\n\nWill you work with the secret paranormal-hunting agency, give the creatures a fair shake (hey, some of them seem all right), or just look out for your otaku friends? Choose your side, choose your missions, and enjoy a freewheeling adventure with AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound & Debriefed.",

        "description": "Below Zero is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean world. It is a new chapter in the Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds.\n\nReturn to planet 4546B\n\nSubmerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to investigate what happened to your sister...\n\nUncover the Truth\n\nAlterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and databanks scattered among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own.\n\nDiscover Uncharted Biomes\n\nSwim beneath the blue-lit, arching expanses of Twisty Bridges. Become mesmerized by the glittering, mammoth crystals of the Crystal Caverns. Clamber up snow covered peaks and venture into the icy caves of Glacial Basin. Maneuver between erupting Thermal Vents to discover ancient alien artifacts. Below Zero presents entirely new environments for you to survive, study, and explore.\n\nConstruct Habitats and Vehicles\n\nSurvive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast across the snowy tundra on a Snowfox hoverbike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Seatruck.\n\nResearch Alien Lifeforms\n\nSomething undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Holefish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan, and visit the adorable Pengwings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.\n\nSurvive the Chilly Temperatures\n\nJump in, the water\u2019s warm. The below zero temperatures of this arctic region pose a new threat. New weather conditions blanket above-ground habitats. Craft a toasty cold suit, sip on piping hot coffee, and warm up next to Thermal Lilies to stave off the chill. \n\nAn ocean of intrigue\n\nWhat really happened to your sister? Who were the aliens who came here before? Why were they on this planet? Can we find solace from grief in truth? Below Zero extends the story of the Subnautica universe, diving deep into the mystery introduced in the original game.",

From the Dropoff Depot and the Shipping Floor, all the way to the Telegraph Desk and the Cassowary Coop out back, the Telepost is a well-oiled mail-processing machine...well, usually. \n\nOvercome Occupational Hazards:\n\nBrave inclement weather (and even weirder stuff) while waddling through the Telepost\u2019s various mailrooms to ensure the residents of Bungalow Basin get their post. From swirling sandstorms and blizzards, to carnivorous plants and paranormal activity, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for Jeff and Debra.\n\nTeam Up or Be Your Own Boss:\n\nTake control of both Jeff and Debra, and test your post processing skills in single-player mode, or team up with a friend to tackle mailroom mayhem in online and local co-op modes. No matter how you play, you\u2019ll have a little extra guidance from the Telepost\u2019s capable staff \u2013 a vibrant cast of postal professionals ready to help your kiwis complete their tasks.\n\nCollect Stamps to Customise Your Kiwis:\n\nCoordinate your kiwis to get messages sent as fast as you can. You\u2019ll earn Stamps at the end of each postal shift, which can be used to unlock new wardrobe accessories to customise Jeff and Debra, making them the best-dressed mail birds in Bungalow Basin. Get creative with hats, facewear, backwear, hairstyles and feather patterns \u2013 there's no dress code at the Telepost!\n\nKeep an Eye Out for Collectibles:\n\nAll sorts of weird things have fallen into the nooks and crannies of the Telepost over the years, and curious kiwis can solve hidden puzzles to find Collectibles that reward special cosmetics.\n\nExperience More Mayhem with Overtime Shifts:\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget you can earn Stamps from doing extra chores at the Telepost. Feed and exercise the cassowaries, plug up the leaky pipes in the basement, make sure the bubble wrap supply is quality controlled and build colleague morale with winter snowball fights; these are just some of the exciting overtime adventures that await!\n\nGet Exclusive Wardrobe Items Only on Nintendo Switch\u2122:\n\nGo medieval on the mailroom with our exclusive knight outfit \u2013 only on Nintendo Switch!

It's Zombies Ate My Neighbors, where you appear in every demented horror flick ever to make you hurl ju-jubes.\n \nWhat are Zeke and Julie, our two wholesome teenage stars doing in a 16-bit game like this?! Trying to save the nice neighbors, cheerleaders and babies from a fate worse than polyester!\n \nWho could put this SLICE of suburbia in such goose-pimply hysteria? Zombies, relentless Chainsaw Maniacs, Mummies, Evil Dolls that just won't die, Lizard Men, Blobs, Vampires, Giant Ants, Martians and more.\n \nWill these crazy kids survive the night? Find your way through 55 horror-filled levels like a grocery store gone bad, a shopping mall awry, a mysterious island and your own back yard. Don't miss \"Weird Kids on the Block\", \"Mars Needs Cheerleaders\" and \"Dances With Werewolves\".\n \nYou can fend off the freaks with a virtual candy counter of weapons like uzi squirt guns, exploding soda pop, bazookas, weed wackers and ancient artifacts. Also grab power ups-o-rama like secret potions and bobo clown decoys. Does this game ever end?!\n \nGhoul Patrol\nZeke and Julie, our intrepid teenagers, visit the Ghosts and Ghouls exhibit at the city library, where they find an old treasure chest containing an ancient spirit book. Naturally, they cannot resist reading it. Suddenly, a horrific snaggle-toothed spirit emerges.\n\nNow, this snarling phantom and his dastardly minions are infesting Metropolis and slithering their way into the history books, where they plan to rewrite history with their spooky ways. Only you have the power to go back in time to de-spook an encyclopedia of zombified historic dudes.\n\nTerminate, with prejudice, using crossbows, ping-pong ball machine guns, Martian \"Heatseeker\" guns, and more.\n\nVaporize garbage can ghosts and ninja spirits, rescue bug-eyed librarians and wigged-out pirates, dodge flying books and adolescent-eating plants!\n\nOnly our two heroes have the power to get the mighty beastly spirit back into his book and stop the madness. Ghoul Patrol to the rescue!\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\u2022\tSave Feature: Quickly save your progress in either game and continue your adventure wherever and whenever you want\n\u2022\tMuseum Features: Watch a video interview with one of the original Zombies' developers or explore numerous galleries containing game art, previously unreleased concept images and marketing assets\n\u2022\t2 Player Mode: Play the game with two player local co-op\n\u2022\tAchievements: Track your game progress with a set of achievements covering both games\n\nPrivacy Policy - https://privacy.thewaltdisneycompany.com/\nTerms of Use - https://disneytermsofuse.com/",

        "description": "The Council oversees the elam families, aristocrats who are descended from the first humans in Rilfanor, and the banlits, who were originally people born without magical abilities. The Guild has never admitted banlits because of their lack of magical capacity; and they've never admitted women because they believed women were too weak-minded to control such power.\n\nNow, many generations later, the elam magic is weakening, and latent magic talent has reappeared among the banlit population. Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.\n\nIn your quest you'll explore randomly generated dungeons, collect treasures, master magic, avoid traps, solve puzzles, and of course cleanse the dungeons of all the evil minions within. Every dungeon is unique, no two locations will ever be the same.\n\nIt's not all dungeon-crawl. Feel at home in your very own Wizard Tower where you can enhance and customize the way you play by building a thriving town, brewing your own reagents, crafting or buying your own gear, powering up your magic, and recruiting help.",

The citizens basked in their new wealth and power, with access to previously unimaginable knowledge. For a while it seemed as if anything was possible.\n\nThis golden age did not last. Knowledge became corrupt, much of it was lies dressed up as truth. Fear, paranoia and hate infected the world with Programs becoming jealous of the resources allocated to others. Throughout this turmoil the real threat went by unseen.\n\nA silent invader watched and waited, planning its attack. The war that followed was brief and devastating. Now there is but one hope. A hero must reboot the system, to turn it \"Off And On Again\" resetting time to before the corruption ever began. Are you that Hero?\n\nOff And On Again tells the story of a hero tasked with rebooting time. The game world is created and destroyed during play, with the hero having the ability to turn parts of the world off and on again. You will be required to use both brains and skill to overcome the enemies and obstacles in your path.\n",

        "intro": "Bullet Hell Insanity + Tower Defense Strategy. A quirky new type of rogue-like shooter. Blast your way through diverse planets. Play solo or online!",
        "description": "A New Kind of Roguelite Shooter. It's time to bring roguelites to the next level! Rogue Star Rescue is a unique mix of bullet hell roguelite and tower defense games. We've added strong strategy elements to the all-out insanity of bullet hell shooters. The action is smooth, the gameplay is challenging, the story is complex and nonlinear. It's a game you'll get sucked into and will end up spending months exploring the multiple intricacies and outcomes. Keeping the game fun well past the 50-hour mark is our core design focus.\n\nOnline Co-op! Games like this are better with friends. Connect with our community online to explore the RSR galaxy with two  people simultaneously! You won't find this feature in the other popular roguelite shooters. Progress with your friends and unlock the secrets of the galaxy as a team. Along with exclusive multiplayer content, there will always be something new to discover.\n\nCouch Co-op! Having a friend over? Team up with them the old fashioned way! Share a screen and blast your way through the RSR universe. Max. 2 players. No internet connection required.\n\nFight with your Team! You won't be able to stop the Rogue Star alone. Rescue your teammates along the way and they'll fight beside you against the evil aliens. Even in single-player mode, your quest is interactive and full of hilarious dialogue, not just another lonely solo-mission.\n\nThe Rogue Star. A massive Rogue Star has formed from the cosmos and is on a direct collision path with us! It threatens to vaporize everything. Leaders from planets around the galaxy have assembled a top team of fighters to stop the Rogue Star at all costs. Choose your own non-linear path through the galaxy and explore each of the 10+ planets carefully.\n\nYour Choices, Your Ending. Choose which planets to travel to and make important decisions that decide the fate of the galaxy! Depending on the path you take, there are dozens of different outcomes. The Rogue Star can destroy the entire galaxy, be reflected to the enemy's galaxy, swallowed by a black hole, sent far away through a galactic wormhole, and dozens of other hilarious possibilities in between. It's really up to you to make the right decisions based on the outcome you want to see, and who you want to rescue.\n\nTraps and Defense. While exploring each planet you must gather traps and resources to face an epic mini-boss and his waves of minions at the end of each level. Strategically placed traps slow, block, push, spike, burn, freeze, and shoot at enemies. Traps can be upgraded to make themselves stronger. Managing trap inventory and usage intelligently is critical to your success in the game, especially during the later levels.\n\nHeroes. Choose from one of the elite team members with a unique set of special abilities, each with a personal drive to save their home planet from annihilation. Unlock new players by achieving specific outcomes.\n\nLevel Up! Unlike traditional roguelikes, we've added a persistent leveling up system. With each level you earn attribute points that can improve strength, speed, health, traps, and luck. The more you fight, the more experience points you earn, the stronger you get. Build your player wisely.\n\nGuns and Items. Discover and unlock hundreds of unique items! We're thrilled to present a wide variety of guns from advanced space weaponry, to historical weapons, and everything in between. On top of carrying your main gun, you'll have an arsenal of powerful grenades ready at the tap of a button. You'll also be accompanied by upgradeable buddies, each with their own unique fighting abilities (Did you know there are dragons in space?).\n\nThree modes of difficulty. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned dungeon explorer, we've got you covered! Choose Wimpy, Normal, or Insane mode to challenge your skills and to keep the fun going. Note for the avid bullet-hell gamers: even the developers have a hard time beating the game on Insane mode ;)\n\nTime is ticking, can you stop this galactic doomsday?",

Every decision is important, be it the jobs you take, the friends you make, or the cards you collect. Death comes quickly, but each play offers new situations and strategies to explore.\n\nPlay as Sal, Rook, or Smith. Three unique character campaigns with their own specialized decks, abilities and maps to explore. Sal is an adventurer out for profit and revenge. Rook is an aging spy working his own agenda. Smith is an idle loafer who might just save the world. Each playable character's story takes place in a unique environment, with different factions and locations to explore and exploit.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBattle Challenging Bosses:\nTest your combat decks against powerful foes with unique mechanics and attacks.\n\nBuild a Team - or Buy One!\nHire mercenaries, find pets, or impose upon your friends to accomplish your goals.\n\nMaster Hundreds of Cards\nEach character has unique negotiation and combat decks to draft from. Get powerful item cards from fallen foes, or as rewards.\n\nDecisions Matter\nKilling foes may incur the wrath of their friends, but sparing them leaves a dangerous piece on the board. Choose wisely, everyone remembers everything you do!\n\nExplore A Broken-Down Sci-Fi World\nThe world of Havaria is a harsh place, full of harsher denizens. Explore lush, hand-illustrated environments full of people who want to kill you\n\nPlaying Politics For Keeps\nEach character has a factional allegiance and an opinion of you. Play politics between rivals, and try to capture the most powerful social boons. But watch out -- doublecross the wrong person, and you'll be subject to their bane!\n\nOutwit or Overpower\nOvercome obstacles with the power of your fists - or your words. You'll need to pick your cards and play them right if you're going to survive. Build two decks simultaneously, balancing the tradeoffs of each.\n\nLearn from each attempted run through the various stories of the Griftlands. Encounter different combinations of enemies, quests, and events every time you play. Your fate is determined by your choices, and by fate.\n",

Improve your summoned monsters by fighting alongside them.\n- Death is not the end: Each try gets you closer to the Necromancer. You will lose all your equipped weapons and monsters, but you will retain half the level you achieved in your run.\n- Learn the truth: Discover Tama and Koko's past as you advance through the dungeon.\n- Local co-op play: Use the Flask of Homunculus to create a copy of the playable character and play with a friend in local co-op game.\n\n\n\"Legend says that, deep within these mountains, a heretic decided to violate the will of the gods in order to achieve eternal life.\n\nThe heretic succeeded in this aberrant attempt, and created a tool for forbidden rituals that could grant immortality\u2026 and even bring back the dead.\n\nOver the years and centuries many have tried to get that power for themselves, but all they found in the Necromancer\u2019s crypt was their demise.\n\nThey say that the tool the Necromancer created is also a weapon\u2026\n\nThe Sword of the Necromancer\u201d\n\nTama is a former rogue that is tasked to escort the priestess Koko in her pilgrimage around the continent. During their travel Koko dies, and Tama carries the corpse to the Necromancer's crypt, where legends say there dwells a power that may resurrect the dead.\n\nFilled with despair, Tama will enter the dungeon with the aim of obtaining the forbidden power of necromancy, ignoring the dangers that lurk in the shadows.",

        "description": "Death Crown is a minimalist real time strategy game in a 1bit style, where you will be play Death herself, commanding her legions of death, and punishing humanity's Kingdom for its overconfidence.\n\nThe Story:\n\nAt the end of the millennial war, when all the cemeteries were overcrowded with the bodies of the dead, came the one who was called The King. Thanks to his unyielding will, The King managed to subdue and unite all the lands. The Kingdom appeared, and the era of the Human began. The King ruled wisely and fairly, but his time on this land ran out: Death came after him. But the will of The King was so strong that he could deny Death.\n\nHe grew so proud that he humiliated Death itself. The idea of the overwhelming power and immortality didn't leave his mind. The King realized that power over the living was not enough for him.\nThe King decided to get the powerful artefact known as the Death Crown. Thus begins the War of the Death Crown.\n\n\nKey features:\n\n-Clear strategic gameplay. Clear strategic gameplay. Everything is very simple: you only have barracks producing troops, mines producing gold, and towers protecting your buildings. Every building is integral to your success!\n\n-Local multiplayer. Punishing pitiful humans in co-op with a friend is much more fun! And after that you can find out which one of you is cooler in the PVP mode.\n\n-A memorable visual style. Seriously, how many strategy games in 1bit do you know?\n\n-Unique story. Upgrade your troops, march through your foe's lands, sowing death and destruction, behold the fall of the Humanity's Kingdom in the breathtaking campaign.",

        "description": "An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions!\n\nThe Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.\n\nThe Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too\u2026\n\nThe Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all!\n\nThe Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits.\n\nThe Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover. Plunder cash from fallen enemies and use it to pimp up your jetboard, jetsuit and max out your weapons for a formidable arsenal. Are you up to the challenge?\n",

Every little corner of the island has been looked after with great detail.

Only one person can wield C.A.R.D.S to take control of Protego\u2019s scattered spy crews and save the world.\n\nYou.\n\nGuided by Protego\u2019s only remaining analyst, Jim Ratio (Greg Miller), you must master the unique powers of each crew in a game of tactical Solitaire like none you\u2019ve ever played before. Guide your crews home in a tale of intrigue where nobody can be trusted. Keep your cool in a world of AI spies and cyber-enhanced operators.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken back control of Protego, play infinitely via Skirmish, or test your skills against the clock in Countdown, a survival mode that will test your grasp of the game\u2019s surprising tactical depths. For a new challenge every day take part in the Daily Hotspot leaderboards!\n\nKey Features:\n* Five modes and counting makes this the biggest Bithell Short yet! Campaign tells a tightly packed story and introduces the game\u2019s mechanics. For an added challenge, take on Campaign Plus instead, with its turn limits and locked tables requiring optimal tactics. The popular Countdown mode tests your endurance with wave after wave of unique decks. Skirmish gives you an infinite playground to enjoy unlocked crews. And, finally, the Daily Hotspot tosses crews into a new bite-size challenge every day.\n* Beautiful original character artwork and atmospheric design put you at the heart of your own cyberpunk conspiracy.\n* No heightened game of Solitaire would be complete without full FMV cutscenes, featuring Greg Miller and Inel Tomlinson in an original story from the team behind Thomas Was Alone, Volume, Subsurface Circular and John Wick Hex.\n* The Return of The Merry and Atlantis Project add new cards, new music and new FMV cutscenes featuring Samantha B\u00e9art and Alanah Pearce.\n* The soundtrack for your adventures is provided by the incomparable Jon Everist.",

        "description": "Written and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters.  \n\n- Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. \n\n- John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. \n\n- Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. \n\nLast Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising stars Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith and Kassian Akhtar as Dylan Hughes. \n\nLast Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. \n\nRoleplay as 3 unique characters. Make choices to shape their conversations. Walk in their shoes and discover where their individual stories lead. ",

However, she regularly receives sexist remarks from some of her peers and can no longer stand it.\n\u2022 Jordan Neal: Jordan is a key player in the Waters University basketball team. The team has qualified for the big university tournament, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the team members. His partner feels this is the perfect opportunity for Jordan to finally introduce him to his teammates.\n\u2022 Jenny: As a student at the prestigious Waters University, Jenny has always had good grades. However, a few weeks before her midterms, she can no longer focus on her studies and is anxious about getting to class.\n\u2022 Paul Hitik: Paul is one of the 5 candidates in the Waters mayoral election. He is aware that his city is the place of many injustices and intends to defend his candidacy to change things on a large scale.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR RELATIVES\nWith dozens of side characters, Best Day Ever deepens many relationships of friendship, love and rivalry. To stay in touch with Emma, Jordan, Jenny and Paul's friends, the phone is your best ally. You can send and receive calls, messages or keep an eye on important appointments.",

Without protection, surrounded by a city that grows up from everywhere, one day she realizes\nthat she is completely alone and won't be able to survive. The only solution is to find her caretaker - a little boy who has been caught up in a whirlwind of human weakness and convince him to take care of her again.

        "description": " Sunblaze is a brain-twisting precision platformer with hundreds of challenging, handcrafted levels to keep you dying for hours and hours.\n\n\u201dWhose blood is that on the walls?\u201d -Josie\n\nJosie is up for a challenge. Her dad, a retired superhero, has fixed his superhero training simulator and lets Josie go in there to play around a bit. After all, show us a parent who wouldn't want to train their daughter to be a superhero? But then suddenly the training room goes rogue, and... Josie is up for a challenge.\n\nIn this tough, hand-crafted precision platformer, you\u2019ll play as Josie, aka. Sunblaze, with a mission to complete your superhero training. The training room is full of puzzles, brain-tickling challenges, obstacles, TNT, spikes, drones... And a purrfect sidekick: the cat. You have got a cat. What else do you need?\n\nWell, skills. That\u2019s what you need. The ever-changing training room keeps on bringing you challenge after challenge, and you'll stay glued up on your controller for hours.\n\nBeing a parent is hard, but most likely not this hard\n\nOk, all the parents who have not lost their kids in a mall or other crowd ever, raise your hands? It's all good, at least you didn't lose them in a hostile superhero simulator full of lasers, evil bots, spikes, and... Well, go and see for yourself!\n\nWARNING: Playing Sunblaze may cause massive brain growth\n\nYou know, to survive all the levels, your brain needs to do some work. We know, we know, it might sound scary, but like Aristotle said: \"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.\", and Quentin Tarantino put it even better: \"Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.\"\n\nOh, are you still reading? Go and get playing right now! We will promise you one thing: dying over 5000 times on one game has never felt this good.\n\n(P.S. Dying is 100% optional, the already easy controls and gameplay can be customized with accessibility features to meet your own needs and wants.)",

        "description": "With an emphasis on exploration and storytelling, Layers of Fear 2 puts you in the center of the scene. You are not just in character, you are the character. The part you play is singularly yours. Written just for you. Beware, though, for all may not truly be what it seems.\n\nYour past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play.\n\nDarkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull. A deep and commanding voice rises from the distance.\n\n\u201cAct!\u201d - it demands.\n\nWhat part will you play?",

Something lurks deep underneath these ruined halls, spewing corruption\u2026 can you defeat whatever it is? And even if you can\u2026 will that really be the end?\n",

        "description": "Survive, gather resources, expand your crew, improve your starship, and pave the way through outer space \u2013 full of hostile races. Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome.\n\u2026and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe.\n\nFLYING AMONG THE STARS\n\nYou are the commander of the \u201cMelistar\u201d (\u201cThe Star Bee\u201d), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.\n\nOTHER SPECIES\n\nThe ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you\u2019ll be forming an alliance with, and who you\u2019ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy...\nWe\u2019ll have to fight and trade \u2013 and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story.\n\nSURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING\n\n* You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out \u2013 and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course \u2013 and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record!\n* If you like branching plots and world exploration \u2013 boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past \u2013 and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not.\n\nMANY EVENTS\n\nAs you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband \u201cset-up\u201d or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly. But the choices within each event will also have to be considered...\n\n...Subjects with the waist of a wasp and a deadly sting; predatory rivals and faction battles; exploring the farthest corners of the galaxy; dangerous challenges and responsible decisions.\nWelcome to the world of CyberHive!\nCommander, we are counting on you.",

Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots.\nFrom thriving villages to crumbling cities, petrified forests and bone-dry ocean beds, this strange new world holds a multitude of terrains to uncover, beautifully rendered in 2D isometric art. Explore, solve puzzles and be prepared to face many tough choices that will shape this land long after you complete your journey.\n \nUNFORGETTABLE FACES\nHumanity as you know it has been totally reforged, and that is most evident by the characters in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION. Technology and mortality have become blurred. Sentient religious robots run rife. Trans-humanistic tribes and leaders have emerged to claim power, and ruthless hunter mercenaries roam the plains. All have adapted to this powerful unknown, and are often at odds with each other. Meet and interact with over forty unique characters, each fully voiced by African voice actors, with thousands of lines of dialogue and multiple conversation paths. Additionally, full CGI cutscenes are scattered throughout the story to bring you even closer to the enthralling sci-fi world and its characters,\n \nMASTERFUL MUSIC SCORE\nBEAUTIFUL DESOLATION features a vibrant and highly experimental soundtrack by none other than Mick Gordon.\n \nREVAMPED FOR CONSOLE CONTROLLERS\nBEAUTIFUL DESOLATION's controls, UI and movement have been fully redone to work intuitively on console controllers. \n\n",

I love creating simple, fun and well designed games. My biggest inspirations are games from the 8-bit and 16-bit era. I like every aspect in the process of making video games: pixel art, coding, game design and drawing. I've worked on several indie games in the past - Castle Of Pixel Skulls is one of my last solo developed games and it was in development for about one year.\n\nKey features: \n\n- 4 different chapters with 10 levels each: a total of 40 levels full of madness and challenges!\n- Dangerous traps and enemies: spikes, fireballs, lava, timed platforms, skeletons, and more!\n- Timed levels: replay the levels as many times as you want and try to beat your previous score.\n- Classic arcade platformer playstyle: old school difficulty of classic NES platform titles.\n- Simple and accessible controls\n- Easy to play, hard to master",

Freely position your party members within the tiers to find unique formations to increase physical or magical attacks, and even your defenses! \n\nExclusive to the Nintendo Switch\u2122 version, additional weapons, armor, and level caps previously only available for purchase on other platforms are now included FREE in-game!\n\nAwaken Your Inner Dragon \u2013 Fill up your Dragon Gauge during battle to harness the power of dragons, drastically increasing your armor and unlocking special abilities! Transforming at low health ups the ante with more powerful attacks but weakened defenses.\n\nWelcome to Devour Hour \u2013 Use the Devour skill on a weakened dragon to obtain skill trees from the enemy. With multiple dragons roaming the land, players can customize unique skill sets for each character!\n\nMadness or Riches? \u2013 Three witches depend on you to bring them dragon\u2019s blood as food. Starve them, and they go mad. Overfeed them, and they become a dragon! Will you keep them alive or sacrifice them to obtain rare items? Your choices will alter the storyline!",

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. \n\nThe game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life.\n\nRenovate and decorate train stations and trains.\nDetailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements.\n\nBuild your own station.\nThanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.\n\nChoose how hard you want to work.\nThe level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.",

        "description": "Only one city remains on the planet, and it\u2019s only robots who inhabit it now. Protected by a glass dome, Endeavor rises above the once lively area and worker robots are trying their best to keep it going. In order to maintain it, every robot has to do its job perfectly and any imperfections found are being discarded.\n\nThrown to a junkyard for a malfunction, a single robot worker is on a quest to get itself fixed. But the city sees this loyal worker as a threat now, so all the robots and defenses that protect Endeavor have turned against their former colleague. With the unique ability to control various machines of the city, including any robots that are in the way, this little Robot is on a mission to fix himself and find intelligent life.\n\nYet it seems that there is no intelligent life left. Only the robots programmed to keep the city nice and clean for people who are nowhere to be found.\n\n\nKey Features\n\nYou are on your own\nLong ago humans vanished leaving behind only their robotic creations. Now the world they left behind is falling apart. Is there anyone out there to help you fix it and discover what happened to the people who used to live here?\n\nYour enemies are your tools\nAlone in the world, the little robot has a special trick up his sleeve: the ability to hack and gain control of any other machines. Use them as you like: you can make them fight each other, explore unreachable places, solve puzzles, or just accompany you in your journey. There are dozens of robots with different abilities for you to explore.\n\nExplore the multifaceted world\nFrom underground facilities to the golden streets of Endeavour, the last city on the planet, your journey will take you across a whole region filled with new challenges, new robots, and mysteries to explore.\n",

I\u2019ve received the cd you had sent me and after a cursory glance at the files, I have to say the chances of recovering the software seem promising. There seems to be some data corruption but it\u2019s quite possible it may still run.\n\nNow, again, I haven\u2019t really dug too deep into it but it appears that it\u2019s some sort of a simple game. I\u2019ve seen plenty of things labelled as \u201cmap\u201d so it probably has many levels. Pretty sure it involves some sort of a gun also? My guess is, it\u2019s most likely one of those retro shooters.\n\nAnyway, gonna go take a nap. Couldn\u2019t really get much sleep last night; had a lot of nightmares, can\u2019t quite remember about what. I\u2019ll keep you updated on my progress.\n\nSincere regards,\nDavid",

Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 2,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!\n\nRevolver and Co features 105 story levels across 7 unique worlds and 12 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission.\n\nOr if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless challenges by completing the story levels, including a grueling hour-long session where the only thing you have to lose is time.",

        "intro": "Adapt and overcome glitches in an ever-changing digital world!",
        "description": "Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death.\n\nTo survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world!\n\u2022 Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective.\n\u2022 Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive.\n\u2022 Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style.\n\u2022 Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!",

Waking up on a stormy rooftop, you meet your saviours: the Unavowed, an ancient society dedicated to stopping evil. Life as you knew it is over, but by joining them you have a chance to reverse some of the damage you\u2019ve done\u2014and, if you choose wisely, to redeem yourself.\n\nShape your hero: Name the playable character, choose their gender, and pick from three origin stories to customize the protagonist.\n\nChoose your party: Select two out of four companions to join you on missions across the boroughs of New York City. Each member of the Unavowed has a unique personality and skillset, providing different solutions to the obstacles you\u2019ll encounter. \n\nFollow your conscience: Difficult choices await. In Unavowed\u2019s subtly branching storyline, your decisions could come back to help you\u2026 or haunt you.\n\nPlay how you want: Controls refined for Nintendo Switch\u2122 allow you to play comfortably with either the Joy-Con\u2122 controllers or the touch screen.\n\n\u201cUnavowed is much more than it appears: it's a brilliantly written adventure that makes you care deeply about its inhabitants and subverts your expectations.\u201d Gamespot, 9/10\n\n\u201cWith a great cast of characters, Unavowed is a stylish urban supernatural fantasy that is touching, funny, endearing, replayable and above all, fun.\u201d Adventure Gamers, 5 stars\n\n\u201cAn adventure game of the highest calibre, with a story that'll grip you from beginning to end.\u201d GamesMaster UK, 90%\n\n\u201cThis game is definitely a fusion of different themes and cultures you see in fantasy stories of all kinds\u2014we have Jinn, fire mages, elementals, mer folk, dragons, dryads, fae, and ghosts. You\u2019d think squashing this many ingredients into a blender would just result in something confused and muddled, but it works REALLY WELL, I am impressed.\u201d Pushing Up Roses (YouTube)",

        "description": "Induction is an abstract puzzle game about time travel and paradoxes. As you master its logic, Induction will rewire how you think about cause and effect.\n\nAcross more than 50 meticulously designed puzzles, you must explore the counter-intuitive possibilities time travel permits. You will learn to choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.\n\nEach puzzle is crafted to reveal a unique aspect of the game\u2019s elegant yet exacting internal logic, gently guiding you into realising the potential of your powers. Induction does not pander, but gives you the satisfaction of mastering an imaginary yet honest set of physical laws.\n\nAccompanying Induction\u2019s minimalist visuals is a rich and responsive ambient soundtrack by Melbourne-based electronic composer and radio broadcaster Tim Shiel.",

        "description": "It was after the descent of uncountable goddesses in Japan...\n\nMost goddesses were able to blend in with humans, living peacefully and happily together. Some of those goddesses even went on to become idols.\nHowever, there were others who simply refused to follow the rules. These goddesses prefer living freely and doing as they please, inadvertently causing all sorts of trouble for humans.\n\nGoddesses who are naughty are called Aragami.\n\nThe protagonist, Sho Narumi, stumbles upon a goddess who collapses on the street and attempts to help her. Soon enough it is revealed that she's the Aragami who had been causing frequent power outages in one small-town area of Tokyo. Sho decides to protect his beloved hometown by helping the goddess to get rehabilitated!\n\n\"Rehabilitate the goddess!\"\n\nWait...aren't goddesses supposed to help humans?\n\nWith the setting moving from Akihabara to a quiet small-town area of Tokyo, the story of one naughty goddess's rehabilitation begins now!",

        "intro": "Fates of Ort is a retro fantasy RPG focused on strategic action, in a land where time is frozen when you stand still. Cast powerful spells - but beware, they will cost you your life. ",
        "description": "Magic is powerful, but it is not free. Every spell you cast requires a little bit of your life energy to spark it. Cast enough spells and you will extinguish your very soul. This means you need to be strategic when fighting, balancing the cost of magic with the risk of taking damage from your enemies.\n\nHow each spell manifests in the world depends on what divine power you choose to combine it with. For example, the Evoke Force spell will cause the ground to erupt with a series of sharp ice crystals, summon a thunderous lightning strike, or barrage the ground with a meteor shower \u2013 all depending on what the spell is combined with.\n\nUse the magic spells at your disposal to defeat the demons spilling out from the underworld. In Ort, time is frozen whenever you stand still. This means you have the opportunity to plan your attacks and be strategic.\n\nLike any RPG, you will be slaying enemies to collect loot and experience. The items you pick up will improve your magical abilities, though some come with curses... As you level up, you will learn additional magic spells to use against your enemies.\n\nOrt is varied and expansive, an open world for you to explore. Choose the order of the quests you pursue, or just explore to meet new characters. The final battle is available whenever you choose, but... Are you strong enough?\n\nPlay as a novice mage, forced to take on the responsibility of saving the world and those that are important to you. Quests can be completed to gain access to new areas, save and unlock allies, gain items and powers, and more. Replays are encouraged because small decisions can have permanent and significant consequences, leading to different game outcomes.",

Your job is simple: protect their dungeons!\n\nFeatures\n\nJoin the Dungeons Company and climb the corporate ladder\nCrush so-called \"heroes\" and protect the company's treasures\nHire monsters, manage your employees and your stock of traps\nDeal with employee strikes and other fun events\n\nRogueDefender\n\nEach run will be different but players will keep some of their Master's bonuses between runs. Like we've already mentioned, our game is a mix between Roguelite and Dungeon Management. How did we achieve that? By running many tests to find the perfect balance between management and dungeon phases!\n\nDungeon Phase\n\nFirst, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin!\n\nYou will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler: heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you placed. When a group of adventurers encounters a group of monsters you positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!",

Well, that\u2019s a shame, but we\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s done.\nYou have to be very careful not to steer your cow in any of the obstacles awaiting you during your flight.\nI mean, why would you want to go hitting a cow against\u2026things?\nThat would be crazy.\nKeep in mind, that typical cows usually wriggle during rope-secured flights.\nWe know that kind of stuff, duh.\nEARN COWCOINS\nFor every kidnapped cow you will be earning cowcoins, obviously. When you\u2019ve earned enough of the marvellous currency, it\u2019s time to go shopping! Sure, you can buy some reasonable gear, which will enhance your flying (why would you do that?) or you can exchange your money for a crazy beak, which will match your mad flapping (highly recommended)!\nWhat else will you find in the virtual store?\nYou will have to play to find out!",

        "description": "Skittles is a game of skill in which the goal is to score exactly fifty points by knocking down pins numbered 1 through 12 with a throw of a wooden stick.\n\nThis Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer.\n \nThe player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down:\n\nIf he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin;\nIf he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points);\nIf a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted.\nFallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary.\n\nThe winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25.\n\nSo as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins or the number 2 pin and only that one pin. If the score is 49, the only solution is to knock down the number 1 pin and no other pins.\n\nThe first player or team to reach 50 points wins the game.\n\nMain features:\n-Full 3D\n-AAA Graphic Engine\n-AAA Physic Engine\n-6 skittle sets with different physical parameters\n-4 Sceneries\n-From one to 4 players",

Spy alarm transmits an invisible infra-red beam from IR Camera at the bottom of the right Joy-Con\u2122, if someone or something crosses the beam, the beams bounces back to the IR Camera which then sounds the alarm. \n\nSpy Alarm works better if placed on the edge of a flat surface with a the range of up to 1 metre and even further when a white or reflective object breaks the beam. \n\nNOTE - Spy Alarm is a fun to play game and should not be used as a real security alarm\n",

        "description": "Your weapon is a magical wooden staff that brave Theofil uses to destroy his enemies. His abilities will help you fight against dangerous enemies.\n\nThe action takes place somewhere in ancient Egypt, full of mysterious temples and caves, which are protected by deadly traps. Access to them is defended by powerful opponents who will not give up without a fight. Stone golems throwing boulders at you and goblins wanting to stab you with a spear. You'll find it all in Theofil!\n\nWatch out for sharp spikes popping out of the ground, fire-breathing ancient statues with images of deities, and flying, poisonous blades. Avoid them to prevent your health bar from dropping to zero. Your dexterity will be the key to discovering the secrets of the ancient world, as their guardians protect access to them. They are cunning and attack you in a group, so keep your eyes around the head!\n\nIn addition to traps and enemies, you will solve puzzles that require cleverness and logical thinking. Move big statues and switch levers to open gates. Jump on platforms to reach the hidden treasures of the ancient world.\n\nTravel through the winding corridors of mysterious temples, bristling with traps appearing on each wall and find a hiding place with a powerful boss. Defeat him to get new items and grow in strength with Theofil! Will you manage to go through the dangerous journey and discover the secrets of the ancient world? Enter the mysterious world of Theofil and follow the path with him! ",

This 16-bit game will bring back many memories for retro fans.\nThe story\n\nLong ago in the Kingdom of Asteborg, a war broke out, pitting humans and demons against each other in a bloody battle. Sagramor, a powerful mercenary, and Maria, a sorceress with fighting magic, joined forces to defeat the demonic army.\nSagramor found a way to lock the demons in an alternate dimension, at the cost of his own life. His sacrifice earned him the title of \"Legend of Asteborg\".\n\nShortly before the end of the war, Maria gave birth to a child named Gareth.\nShe died 4 years later.\n\nGareth was then taken in by the royal orphanage, and Bohort, the leader of the armed troops, saw in him an invaluable potential. He trained him from an early age to become a formidable warrior.\n\nDecades later, Zadimus, the former leader of the Demons, who survived the great war, found a way to reopen the portal to the parallel dimension in order to free his fellow Demons and declare war on the humans in order to take back the Kingdom of Asteborg.\n\nAs Gareth, now the royal guard of Asteborg, you will go on an adventure, braving the lands of the kingdom and its dangerous lands populated by bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nAlong the way, you'll learn more and more about the ancient war and your identity.\nBut beware, Zadimus won't let you get away with it...",

        "intro": "Hindsight 20/20 is a 3D third-person action RPG with morality decisions. Discover the power of your morality with choices and actions that truly matter.",
        "description": "Hindsight 20/20 - Wrath of the Raakshasa is a 3D third-person action RPG where players can fix mistakes from past playthroughs and relive them for vastly different gameplay and story experiences. Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences. \n\nHindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars:\n\n1. Choice in Combat: \nDecide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good. \n\n2. A Malleable World: \nChampaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan\u2019s choices and actions.\n\n3. Interesting AI and Bosses: \nAll NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20\u2019s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan. \n\n4. The Experience Engine: \nThe Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20.\n\n5. Ten different endings:\nHindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey.",

Pinocchio will learn to obey, to be responsible, not to trust strangers and to appreciate school, but most importantly: it teaches us the importance of telling the truth. All this is told accompanied by beautiful drawings. \n\n Two levels of play, 'senior' (for adults) and 'junior' (for children aged 3+), guarantee hours of entertainment for all.\n\n Become an expert and finish the puzzles in the shortest possible time and you will find yourself amongst the best in the world on the online leaderboard.\n\n You can also play with friends and family in the one-on-one split-screen competition mode. Your rival won't make it easy for you! Don't give up - fill an energy bar to perform a counterattack and put them in their place.\n\n Or have fun working together to complete the puzzles in Cooperative (co-op) mode.",

Outmaneuver your frenemies and shatter them into colorful bits.  \n\nARENAS \nBattle around the galaxy in fifteen arenas, with new ones coming. Classic asteroids, icy comets, mythical monsters, curious contraption, it is all there for you to chart a route before the match. Each arena puts you in perils, which you can turn into opportunities and use to your advantage  \n\nSHIPS \nAll the ships in Have a Blast are small and nimble, enabling you to navigate the busy arenas. Each of the five ships has a unique powerful ability, requiring a slightly different approach. But even the strongest attacks can be countered, and it is never too late to turn the tide of battle to your side.  \n\nGAME MODES \n- Deathmatch \u2013 Last pilot standing wins the round in this familiar mode. Be the first to win five rounds and you win the match.  \n\n- Team match \u2013 Any combination of players is possible in a team vs team play. Great opportunity to reinforce some friendships and ruin others.  \n\n- Mothership \u2013 Keep your mothership safe and it will provide you with health, ammo and some refuge. Lose your mothership and you\u2019ll be toast very soon.  \n\n- Challenges - Try every ship and every environment by completing specific challenges against the computer.  \n  \nBOTS \nAdd bots to any match. Driven by a capable AI, they can provide some challenge when friends are not around; or you can use them to add energy to matches. If the adaptive AI gets frustrating or too easy, you can always adjust the challenge from the menu.  \n\nWE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR RETRO-INSPIRED MODERN-DESIGNED ARCADE! ",

The Ghost Face DLC includes two exclusive items for The Ghost Face: the body Monochrome Maniac and weapon Silvery Steel Tactical Knife. These items are only available as part of the DLC.\n\nAcquaintances are a dangerous deception. The workplace is filled with them; strangers seated beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise. No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.\n\nThe Ghost Face took full advantage of that fact, blending in the everyday. He would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. \n\nBut this time he found a richer hunting ground\u2026\n",

        "description": "About Raptor\nRaptor is a rookie in the Lethal League. He comes from the south. Raptor is young but also very determined to win. His weapon is a metal baseball bat. With his special ability he is able to hit the ball twice.\n\nAbout the outfit\nIn an attempt to find out more about his past Raptor traveled to Citynetics. Shine City's biggest construction company. After infiltrating the Citynetics factory with the help of Switch, he locked himself in one of the higher offices. Scrambling through some important documents, he noticed the names of the board directors. Reginald, Edgar and Xavier Saur. Suddenly a loud bang. The guards had him in a corner. Having lost his baseball bat along the way, Raptor grabbed the gear he could find and mowed himself through the door.\n\n- The Heavyduty R. Evolution outfit. A bright overall with warning sign colors.\n- The Nightmare Survivalist outfit. A fever dream inspired monster look.",

However, there are also more access points to sneak contraband into the prison.\n\nChain Link Up: Maximize your prison\u2019s efficiency by linking docks, helipads, and roads to specific deliveries. Toggle what services are available to each delivery point within your compound.\n\nSupermax Security: New security objects make it easier to search deliveries and prisoners. Additional emergency services can also be called when things get out of hand.\n\nIsland Life: Customize your island with over 15 nautical tiles and objects. Shape the land around your compound with moats, rivers, and lakes for security, or for style -- no access roads needed!\n\nThe Rock: Manage the infamous Alcatraz Prison and Alcatraz Island with two premade maps.",

Some time passed and in a stroke of luck, Latch detected his lifeless body on his Robo-Sub's sonar. While in Latch's care, Dice bandaged his own diseased skin and quickly fled into the darkness as if possessed by some primal instinct. He was spotted destroying his long time rival Doombox in a match not long after.\n\n- The Late Stage Illmatic colorway.

In between vats filled with spinal cords that didn't seem human, she found what she was looking for. Gear for a special occasion.\n\n- The Nuclear Nourishment colorway. A dark nurse themed outfit with a biohazard spinal fluid injection arm.\n- The N. N. Second Opinion colorway. A cute twist on the Nuclear Nourishment outfit, but the needles go just as deep.",

Produce can be exported or used as ingredients for inmate meals.\n\nRoom to Grow: Three outdoor rooms facilitate farming: Fruit Orchard, Farm Field and Vegetable Allotment. But that\u2019s not all, players can recruit staff Farm Workers, build a Pantry to store produce, and construct a Shed to house farming-related items.\n\nTrouble is Brewing: With new crops comes new contraband. Prisoners can now secretly grow herbs in the fields and swipe kitchen ingredients to brew Booze. Fields can also become Gang Turf, so keep your guards on alert!\n\nA Greener New Deal: Prisons get an eco-friendly makeover with Solar, Wind, and Solar/Wind Hybrid power sources. Excess power created by these sustainable methods can be sold back to the grid using the Power Export Meter.\n ",

She pleaded to them to try and find the jetpack, to no avail. They sure weren't risking their lives for some 'toy'. Jet, not one to give up on a friend, smoothly zipped into one of their spare suits and jumped into the fire.\n\n- The Firefighter Max Pressure colorway.

Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the Survivor: Yun-Jin\u2019s Polka Dotted Blouse.\n\nThe new killer is Ji-Woon Hak, better known to fans across the globe as The Trickster. Famed singer by day, calculating serial killer by night, The Trickster thirsts for notoriety above all, treating both his music and his murders as high art. He was beckoned into The Fog on the eve of his most gruesome performance with the promise of an eager audience and an endless encore. The new Survivor is Yun-Jin Lee, a resilient and ambitious music producer who built her reputation on the success of her one and only client \u2013 The Trickster. Ignoring evidence of his true nature in favor of her career, Yun-Jin now stands to pay the ultimate price for her decision.",

For her weapon, she uses a devastating laser cannon that appeared in the EDF: IR world. The longer you fire it, the stronger it gets, and at maximum output it can deliver some ruinous results. Now, THIS is pure power.",

ILI, an autonomous android who for some reason works at Dream Club, apparently wants to prove her true potential by saving the Earth. Despite being an android, performance-wise she is comparable to a human. With her innocent heart (AI?), she would never shoot beams from her eyes, or do anything of that sort. But hoping to find batteries, she was coaxed into joining the EDF and modded into a tool of destruction: for her Ability she can float in midair, and for her SP Move she causes javelins to rain from the sky. Although she really only needs manganese batteries to function, for her weapon she's been equipped with a massive automatic shotgun paired with a reflector shield. Now, THIS is pure power.",

Players will be rewarded for each rehabilitated inmate and fined for each reoffender.\n\nRoom for Improvement: Inmates with existing or earned work credentials can become vendors to both prisoners and visitors in inmate-run rooms, including a Bakery and Restaurant.\n\nBack to Society: Inmates can earn work experience by partaking in different work and training programs.",

Purchasing the add-on unlocks the new Killer, both Survivors, and an exclusive universal Charm: Umbrella Corporation. \n\nThe Resident Evil Chapter includes a new map: The Raccoon City Police Station. Once home to the RPD\u2019s elite S.T.A.R.S. unit, the labyrinthine hallways of this converted art museum are now overrun by the undead and host to a relentless evil. The new Killer is Nemesis. Take control of Umbrella\u2019s bloodthirsty bio-organic weapon and hunt your targets without mercy. The new Survivors are Leon S. Kennedy and Jill Valentine. Unflinching in his mission to expose Umbrella, Leon has proven himself a true survivor since his first day with the RPD. Jill is a brilliant S.T.A.R.S. agent, one of the only surviving members of her unit, and a hard target for even the most unrelenting adversary. ",

Face 8 new bosses and summon 10 new monsters! \n\nTo unlock the new modes you will also need to have achieved the perfect ending of the base game.\n\n*Challenge Mode\n\nRevisit the base mode in this randomized challenge. In this new mode you will advance through the five floors of the dungeon as usual, but things will be different this time!\n\n*Colosseum Mode\n\nShow your might against hordes of enemies! Starting from level 1 and without any items, take on the waves of enemies and advance to the next level. Chain combos and make your combo meter grow, as it determines how much experience you will get and increase the probability of getting better items in the chests!\n\n*Boss Rush\n\nFight against 5 bosses without rest! Fight against tougher bosses (both old and new) in succession, with only what you can bring with you: Level up and gear up to face them! Win a miniboss to summon after completing this mode!\n\n*Dungeon Builder\n\nCreate or play custom dungeon floors! Create a floor layout, select its appearance, the enemies you want to appear and the boss at the end. You can even choose what items will appear in the chests and their properties, so you can set a challenge for yourself or for the others who play your Dungeon, as you will be able to share it with a simple text code!\n\n*Item Shop\n\nWhen completing one of the other modes, you will get Symbols that you can exchange for items in the Item Shop. The item offer will be the same for everyone playing the game that day, and changes every day. This is also an easy way to get all the weapon and relic types, needed for achievements.\n\n*Epilogue\n\nComplete the Extra modes to unlock a new chapter in the story!",

Build & manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

        "description": "What would you do to bring back someone you love?\n\nSword of the Necromancer is a dungeon-crawler action RPG with Rogue-like elements where you can revive your defeated enemies to make them fight alongside you.\n\nTurn your foes into allies using the forbidden powers of the Sword of the Necromancer and help Tama reach the dungeon's depths in order to gain enough power to bring Koko back from the dead.\n\nGather a little army of monsters, equip yourself with weapons and relics and level up to take on the guardians that stand between you and your objective.\n\n- Turn your foes into allies: use the Sword of the Necromancer to revive defeated monsters and make them fight alongside you.\n- Gather weapons and relics: each weapon is different from the others thanks to the procedural  weapon generation system, which gives them various effects and attributes.\n- Fight with all your might: defeat your enemies using a variety of weapons and objects and dominating the fluid head-to-head battle system.\n- Level up: enhance your character by fighting enemies and upgrade your stats. Improve your summoned monsters by fighting alongside them.\n- Death is not the end: Each try gets you closer to the Necromancer. You will lose all your equipped weapons and monsters, but you will retain half the level you achieved in your run.\n- Learn the truth: Discover Tama and Koko's past as you advance through the dungeon.\n- Local co-op play: Use the Flask of Homunculus to create a copy of the playable character and play with a friend in local co-op game.\n\n\n\"Legend says that, deep within these mountains, a heretic decided to violate the will of the gods in order to achieve eternal life.\n\nThe heretic succeeded in this aberrant attempt, and created a tool for forbidden rituals that could grant immortality\u2026 and even bring back the dead.\n\nOver the years and centuries many have tried to get that power for themselves, but all they found in the Necromancer\u2019s crypt was their demise.\n\nThey say that the tool the Necromancer created is also a weapon\u2026\n\nThe Sword of the Necromancer\u201d\n\nTama is a former rogue that is tasked to escort the priestess Koko in her pilgrimage around the continent. During their travel Koko dies, and Tama carries the corpse to the Necromancer's crypt, where legends say there dwells a power that may resurrect the dead.\n\nFilled with despair, Tama will enter the dungeon with the aim of obtaining the forbidden power of necromancy, ignoring the dangers that lurk in the shadows.",
