        "description": "Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and seemingly cursed Island.

No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you\u2019ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air...",

        "description": "\u201cDream Alone has a simple premise and a big atmosphere, with a background design that is genuinely chilling and puzzles that will make you think.\u201d 8/10, Pure Nintendo\n\nDream Alone is a 2D platforming game with classic platform gameplay, deadly traps, a dark storyline and unique hero abilities. \n\nA mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. \n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! \n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.",

Build & manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of immersive sims and RPGs.\n\nRather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.\n\nIn order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through the use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.\nWill you play as a soldier who shoots first and asks questions later?\nA stealthy doctor who uses chloroform and tranquilizer darts to take down the opposition?\nOr how about a gorilla, rescuing other caged gorillas to form a small mobilized gorilla army?\n\n\n",

Follow the software instructions to download the floor plan maps and print them out.\n\nStory\nYou are a new employee at a real estate agency. Apparently in this city, there are many properties with ghosts living in them! In Madorica Real Estate, you have to search for the only property that doesn\u2019t have ghosts in the entire city.\n\nYour job requires you to exorcise the ghosts in each room so that the new owners can live there in peace. Hints to beating the ghosts can be found around the rooms and from Mr. Madorica. If you use the hints to solve the puzzles and input the commands, even a newbie real estate agent like you can use magic!\n\nSearch for hints, jot down notes on your floor plan maps, and seek out magic to exorcise all the ghosts!",

Crush, kill and maim your enemies with an arsenal of savage weapons as you and your friends take on the minions of evil. Upgrade your village, upgrade your skills and upgrade yourself (seriously, this game will make you a better person).\n\nConan Chop Chop is the most epic and realistic stick figure game ever to be set in the world of Conan the Barbarian. Discover a delightfully savage world full of epic boss fights, perilous dungeons, and endless amounts of loot and item combinations. \n\n\nONLINE AND COUCH CO-OP \nWhile you can choose to save the world solo, Conan Chop Chop really puts the party in \"party game\" when you step into its multiplayer mayhem. Featuring 1-4 player online and couch co-op, you can choose to play by yourself, with friends, or random people as you save the world from damnation. \n\nUNIQUE CAST OF HEROES \nWant to get up close and personal, or shoot your opponents from afar? Choose from a cast consisting of the most famous heroes in Hyboria, from the sword-swinging Conan to the bow-bending B\u00ealit. Chop, shoot, or simply blast your foes into tiny bits. \n\nLEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTERS \nIn Conan Chop Chop, what kills you also makes you stronger. Use the experience you earn from each run to unlock character-specific perks and abilities to conquer the enemies that defeated you. \nBuild the skill tree for each one of the characters and discover their unique builds. \n\nTRILLIONS OF ITEM COMBOS \nAcquire new skills as you venture to the far reaches of the world, looting magical charms, weapons, and armors. Experiment with different item combinations to discover potentially overpowered abilities and new ways to play. \n\nMAGICALLY GENERATED WORLD \nNo two runs through Conan Chop Chop are the same, thanks to procedurally generated maps and dungeon layouts. Discover new shops, challenges and treasures with every playthrough. \n\nRUTHLESS BOSS FIGHTS \nTest your might against unique dungeon bosses, such as The Giant Sand Worm of Koth and The Frost Giant of Vanaheim. Some bosses may even roam the wilderness, guarding golden chests, powerful artifacts, and other riches.",

A time of great change is also a right time for new discoveries and innovation in science. Cities are built around great monuments like gigantic zeppelin hangars and observatories.\"\n\nFeatures:\nA campaign mode containing 26 missions with 3 difficulty levels\nA sandbox mode for unlimited fun\nOver 24 different resources to manage\nMore than 40 different buildings and 4 unique Monuments\nOver fifteen different characters that roam the city\nMaps that reach up to 300 per 300 box tiles\nAn amazing soundtrack with over 20 different songs\n\nThis Nintendo Switch\u2122 version includes new features such as gamepad controls (and partly touch screen), new user interface to perfectly fit the Nintendo Switch\u2122 screen and a smoother difficulty curve!",

The main essence of the game is research locations and puzzles, plunging in the dramatic story of a little girl suffering from asthma.\n\nThe main character - Sasha Anders, a thirteen year old girl who awakens from a nightmare. The world seems to be upside down for her. Everything becomes so strange. The house is imbued with loneliness and longing and it seems strange to our character considering it was always dominated by love and harmony. Everywhere except for the heroine's room, suspiciously darkens, without even a single sound. Her parents and younger brother have gone missing. The girl is smart and sensible beyond her years, but each person has their own fears, and sometimes they cannot cope. This is especially troubling Sasha, due to the slightest fear, she feels suffocated.\n\nThe story that we'll tell you penetrates deep in your heart and leaves the experience forever. The saddest part of this mystical tale, is that it is not a tale at all. This is the story of a little girl, the story of Sasha Anders.\n",

        "description": "When a recent breakup lights Holland\u2019s social media ablaze, she hopes to find some breathing room out in the real world\u2014but as plugged-in as everyone is, it seems impossible that she'll ever get a break. In Land of Screens, guide Holland on her new mission to ditch the social media saturation and discover some real-world relationships by enlisting the help of a few new friends, some synthy chiptune jams, and the inimitable chemistry of small children and adorable animals.\n\nA Point-And-Click Adventure of Internet Escapism\n\nPut on your fanciest mingling cap to conquer harrowingly familiar challenges such as:\n\u2022 Navigating an impromptu party where your only choices of company are strangers\u2014or worse: friends you haven\u2019t seen since high school.\n\u2022 Meandering through a hotel lobby to force awkward introductions with fellow attendees of a professional conference.\n\u2022 Making the best of last-minute concert plans where you\u2019ve never heard of the band, been to the venue, or met any of the people you\u2019re there with.\n\u2022 Family. Reunions.\n\u2022 Getting your friends excited about doing nature stuff so they can convince other people to start doing nature stuff so you can all spend the day doing nature stuff.\n\nJust Get Everyone to Stop Looking at their Phones\u2026 No Problem.\n\nNo matter where Holland goes to try and get away, everyone is glued to their screens. She\u2019ll need the help of old friends and new acquaintances\u2014and they\u2019ll need help from her\u2014to dodge the online madness and finally unplug for a while. By diving (or stumbling) into fresh experiences, new relationships, and accidental adventures, Holland might just stand a fighting chance of escaping the ever-present creep of social media drama.\n\nRemember How Nice it is to Talk at People\u2019s Actual Faces?\n\nIn a world stuck on digital connections, the only way Holland is going to get through this breakup with her sanity intact is to go analog. Fortunately, she\u2019ll soon learn just how many enticing adventures are out there, away from the continuous social media commentary. Sure, she could obsess over an online thread of opinions about her breakup like everyone normally would, but maybe there\u2019s another way\u2026",

        "description": "You got caught smuggling VHS tapes across the border, and now there's hell to pay. You want to find an elusive rare bird in the forest and snap its picture. You have to kill a man in the back room of a shady diner.\n\nThis is Paratopic, an experimental first-person horror game named by Rock, Paper, Shotgun as one of the best games of 2018, and by FACT mag as having one of the top 10 soundtracks of the year.\n\n\u2022 A narrative-driven horror-tinged adventure game that takes you on a journey through a cruel fever dream world.\n\n\u2022 Cut between numerous detailed and varied vignettes to unravel how the stories of three separate characters intersect.\n\n\u2022 Explore the detritus of forbidden industry, kill, drive through the night, find yourself in conversation with some very off-kilter individuals.\n\n\u2022 A leisurely playthrough should take forty-five minutes, give or take, with plenty more to discover in the detailed, grimy low polygon environments. Or speedrun it, if you'd prefer.\n\n\u2022 Over an hour of gorgeous dark ambient music is used to create our subtly dynamic soundscape. An anachronistic blend of modern and outdated production as glitches and textural pads meet synthesis & sampling akin to 1990s Unreal Engine soundtracks.\n\n\u2022 Playable both in TV and handheld mode, experience a critically acclaimed short-form masterpiece at home or on the go. Take the horror with you.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\u201cParatopic sticks with you. It's the kind of game that lingers, haunting the dark corners of your mind after its credits roll. There's something off about it in a delightful way; the atmospheric fever dream of low-poly horror imagery shows, but never tells.\u201d\nDestructoid\n\n\u201cParatopic\u2018s city is a sooty husk, a ruin whose scarce inhabitants eke out day-to-day existence by taking dangerous smuggling jobs, murdering for money, or reconfiguring their flesh in agonized cathode-ray rapture.\u201d\nHeterotopias\n\n\u201cParatopic is a short first-person horror game which draws ideas from Thirty Flights Of Loving but takes them somewhere terrible, leading them down an alley and through an unmarked door into a world which looks a bit like ours but just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nAWARDS\n\nExcellence in Audio Winner 2019\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nNuovo Award Nominee\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nExcellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nThe Best PC Games of 2018 So Far\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nFavorite Games of 2018\nAVClub\n\nThe 10 Best Video Game Soundtracks of 2018\nFACT mag\n\nBest Horror Games of 2018\nBloody Disgusting",

        "intro": "Hardcore roguelike about dungeons with hybrid battles, combining classical turn based combat system and a collectible card game. Collect the best spells and conquer the dungeons!",
        "description": "Battles\nThis game is a unique mix of rogue-like with dungeon exploration, RPG, turn-based tactics and collectible card game. At the base of the turn-based system are not turns, but time. Find and improve new heroes and get coins to buy new spells. But remember, a hero\u2019s death will be fatal.\n\nHeroes\nEvery hero has a special perk and a spell, in addition to the three stats (strength, dexterity, endurance). Gather your team of heroes, come up with unique tactics for battles. Traditional Tank, Healer and Warrior? Or would you only use brute force?\nDuring battles, the pre-selected 20 cards with spells are mixed into the deck. Every 6 seconds of combat you take a new card into your hand. During the normal turn, you will have a choice of actions:\n- Normal attack;\n- Defense;\n- Position change;\n- Casting a hero's spell (one for each);\n- Casting spells from hand\n\nEach spell, be it heroic or from a deck has its own mana cost. \n\nMana is shared by all heroes and accumulates during battle. The player will have to choose which spell to use now, because there may not be enough mana for the next one.\n\nDungeons\nSend your heroes to the most dangerous adventure \u2014 Dungeons of Nexoria. Randomly generated floors with a boss at the end of each. Not everyone will be able to return, but those who can will gain great glory!\n\nEvents\nExploration of dungeons is fraught not only with crowds of enemies that need to be destroyed, but also random events and traps, the outcome of which could be fatal.",

In the Sudoku mode, the player is tasked to fill out a 9 x 9 field with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, each column and each 3 x 3 sub-field contains exactly one occurance of each of the numbers 1 to 9. \n\nPermudoku is a variation of the classic Sudoku puzzle, where instead of numbers, colours have to be placed on a 9 x 9 in such a way that each colour appears exactly once in each column, row and 3 x 3 sub-field. However, from the beginning, all fields are already coloured, the player's task is to swap fields around until the colours are distributed correctly. Both game modes include five different degrees of difficulty with 100 puzzles each, for a total of 1000 puzzles. \n\nFinally,  In Nonodoku, it is the aim of the player to produce a pixel image using the number hints. The player is presented with a grid of white boxes. Numbers on the side and atop indicate how many boxes need to be coloured black in a row. Each number signifies one continuous line of black boxes, between the black boxes for two successive numbers, at least one space must remain white.",

Think fast, use proper tools, and don\u2019t mess up\u2026\nLeave one smear of blood and you\u2019re in trouble. All of this in a low-poly noir style.\n\nHIDE BODIES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!\nHide the body in a locker, dump it off the coast or put it in a barrel full of acid, the choice is yours!\nStart with some simple cleanups, work your way up by completing new orders.\nNo jobs are the same, but each one requires you to be quick and professional!\n\nGET INTO THE WORLD OF CRIME\nDevelop your own style, accept jobs from the cops to the mafia, and find a unique way to complete each one of them.\nMeet new characters on your way up. Follow the storyline full of plot twists, low-poly bloody scenes, wicked sense of humour and tons of references.\nAlways stay sharp, expect the unexpected, and of course... leave no evidence.\n\nVARIOUS MECHANICS\nCan\u2019t open the door? Get that lockpick out and work that lock.\nUse a mop, a brush soaked in some soap, or a nearby hose to make the mess disappear.\nYou should probably use some luminol to expose some hidden blood stains as well\u2026\nCuz the police won\u2019t miss those!\nThen just leave carrying the corpse in a body bag like nothing ever happened.\n\nTHERE IS NO TIME FOR FEAR\nEvery order is not just a body to ditch, but also a race against time.\nAny blood stains left behind will only lead you to one place\u2026\nFail one order for the mafia, and you better start digging your own grave.\nBody Of Evidence is full of dangers, and if you want to exist in this business, don\u2019t let the fear beat you.",

        "description": "Together, they\u2019re the Freelance Police. And they\u2019re about to save the world.\n\nIn 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.\n\nNow everyone\u2019s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.\n \nIt\u2019s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \u201cspinny thing\u201d they do with their eyes.)\n \nWho\u2019s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam\u2019s nose for detective work, Max\u2019s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max\u2019s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.\n\nReturn to the adventure game that was once called \u201cgaming\u2019s first sitcom\u201d and is today known as \u201cthe remaster you didn\u2019t know you were waiting for.\u201d With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con\u2122 and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN\u2019s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch\u2122 library.\n",

The remastered version is bigger & better than the original - the definitive way to play. This gem is challenging to master, but you will quickly get the hang of it, once you start playing!\n\nA NEVERENDING EXPERIENCE\n\nThere is always something new to discover when it comes to this beloved enduro platformer. When you think you have completed all the levels and collected all the goodies, it\u2019s time to go online and compete on the leaderboards, or play together with a friend for a new perspective on old levels. And don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t run out of content - there are more than a hundred additional levels in this version, with even more on the way.\n\nA CULT CLASSIC\n\nThe days of floppy disks, CRT monitors and dial-up internet are long gone, but our old school favorite outlived them all - and it\u2019s still going strong. A lot has happened in the past two decades, but this fully formed cult classic is still the same \u201chard, but casual, but hard\u201d retro game we all love. Play it now in its best form!",

Every little corner of the island has been looked after with great detail. Trust me, it took us a while to make it\n- Join Alba and Ines to found the AIWRL (really rolls off the tongue doesn't it?), an organisation that can save the island\n- You will need to gather a bunch of volunteers and the town is full of good people.

        "description": "You\u2019re not special. You\u2019re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet.\n\nThere is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.\n\nABOUT BACKBONE\n\nBackbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation.\n\nBackbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nBackbone\u2019s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.\n\nAs Howard, you will:\n\u2022 Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth\n\u2022 Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be\n\u2022 Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver\n\u2022 Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss\n\u2022 Be a raccoon\n\nFEATURES\n\nPost-noir dystopia\nBackbone\u2019s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It\u2019s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.\n\nStunning visuals\nThe breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.\n\nEvocative and unforgettable soundtrack\nOriginal doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone\u2019s OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling. ",

        "description": "This is not Moorhuhn's first appearance in a new game genre on the Nintendo Switch\u2122. We hunted it mercilessly in Moorhuhn Remake, defended the Wild Wild West with it in Moorhuhn Wanted and competed in heated races in Moorhuhn Kart. Guide the Moorhuhn through the jungle in his first jump and run platformer for Nintendo Switch\u2122!\n\nThe Quest for the WHATSIT\nAn amulet lost 1000 years ago, the WHATSIT, has always been the Holy Grail of treasure hunters. Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic. And so, he unceremoniously drops himself above the dense jungle and plunges headlong into the adventure.\n\nIn the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT!\n\nHidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter.\n\nAs you would expect from a proper jump and run platformer, you need to use all your physical strength, courage, and skill. Jumping and swinging, kicking, boxing and sometimes even shooting, Moorhuhn races through the depths of the jungle to find the treasure of treasures: The Amulet of WHATSIT.\n\nBut before that, there are all kinds of hostile opponents to defeat, obstacles to overcome and traps to avoid. And then there are some valuables to be found and collected.\n\nYou can replay unlocked levels at any time to improve your final score.\n\nBut that is not all! 6 new bonus levels not included in the original game bring further fun and the opportunity to collect additional points.\n\nAnd when there is nothing left to collect and all the opponents have been defeated, you can still try to achieve a new best time.\n\nFEATURES:\n\u2022 21 jam-packed Jump and Run levels\n\u2022 6 bonus levels\n\u2022 Jungle soundtrack\n\u2022 Animal animations\n\u2022 Cool bonus treasures\n\u2022 Rankings \u2014 Beat your own top scores over and over again and compete against friends and players around the world for the top position in the online leaderboard.\n\u2022 Online/Offline \u2014 Play whenever and wherever you like. No internet connection is needed to play. However, you will need an internet connection to upload your top score to the global leaderboard and see other players\u2019 scores.\n\u2022 Community \u2014 With more than 15 million games sold, Moorhuhn is one of the best-known and most successful game characters. Join the large Moorhuhn community now!\n\nMoorhuhn speaks English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian.\n\nEnough talk. Get the game now and jump into the adventure!",

        "description": "The player, in the role of a painter who has made a deal with the devil, has to find his way back to the real world after being cheated and trapped into one of his canvases. A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist\u2019s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou find yourself on an evolving island.

The appearance of a ship, the rise of a lighthouse, each mystery you uncover and puzzle you solve will unfold new wonders and unveil new places to explore. But be forewarned, the scene you find yourself in, this breathtaking land of paint and oil is not always as straightforward as it appears. This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended.\n\nSTORY\nPrague\nJuly 20th 1945\n\nThe city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war.\nBuildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever.\nA painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal.\nThe chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal.\nA few moments later, the house was empty.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Unique artstyle and a surreal environment to explore\n- A collection of clever puzzles that will challenge your creativity\n- An ever-changing world that develops as you progress\n- Hidden secrets to find",

        "description": "Play the digital adaptation of the beloved tabletop board game. Root is a game of adventure and war where 2 to 4 players battle for control of a vast wilderness.\n\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.",

It is centered around Sophie's quest of searching for Plachta after they are separated in a dream world of Erde Wiege, and the new friends they meet there.\n\nMain features:\n- Evolved Seamless Turn-Based Battles\nThis game incorporates new multi-link turn battles that feature six party members divided in two teams and begin seamlessly when players encounter enemies while exploring. The combat experience is enriched by a multitude of special effects and actions, including special Dual Trigger skills that involve two of the team members attacking in unison.\n\n- Two Types of the Panel-Based Synthesis\nThis game features an accessible puzzle-like synthesis system where you place ingredients on a panel to create new items. Players can choose to use either the Standard Panel or the Restricted Panel, which will increase both the difficulty level and the rewards.\n\n- Manipulate the Weather to Open New Paths\nWhile each region of Erde Wiege has fixed weather, you will be able to change this with the help of special tools. Changing the weather will allow you to not only change the scenery when visiting the same area but also gain access to new, previously inaccessible places. Perhaps the weather will affect even the materials you can collect?\n\nNote: Costumes can be changed in the \"Changing Room\" at the desk in the atelier.\nPlease visit the official website for more information. \nPlease beware that the main game is currently also available for purchase as a part of the \"Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream Digital Deluxe Edition\" set and \"Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream Ultimate Edition\" set.",

Sail stormy waters, dive unknown depths, and explore forgotten ruins in a beautifully realised, flooded world. \n\nAN ALL-NEW COMPANION TITLE\nExpanding on the desolate setting seen in FAR: Lone Sails, Changing Tides swaps sun scorched, dusty planes for stormy skies and high seas. With new environments, puzzles and ship mechanics, the world of FAR: Changing Tides brings an exciting experience to fans of this beloved series and new players alike with a bigger, deeper challenge.\n\nA NEW HOME\nOvercome the elements as new protagonist, Toe, who awakens to find themselves alone, stranded in a flooded world. What once was home is transformed into an unfamiliar and sometimes hostile environment. You must navigate Toe on an adventure to traverse the ruins of a once great society in search of a new beginning. \n\nCAPTAIN YOUR SHIP\nExperience the thrill of captaining a distinctive seafaring vessel. Together you\u2019ll brave high seas, navigate intense storms, and plumb the perils of a briny deep. Along the way, you\u2019ll need to keep things functioning by unlocking parts, fixing faults and searching the watery depths for precious fuel and salvage. The farther you travel, the more you\u2019ll learn about your ship\u2019s fascinating complexities.\n\nA MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE\nFAR: Changing Tides\u2019 moments of peril and intrigue are delivered by environmental dangers and puzzles to overcome, but these feed into the solitary, almost meditative approach to gameplay. Captaining your extraordinary ship, raise the mast, hoist and angle the sails, light the furnace and more as you learn to sail the ocean while mourning the loss of your home.\n\nSOUNDS OF THE OCEAN\nA dynamic soundtrack reacts to player and environmental actions, amplifying key moments in the game and heightening the atmosphere, meaning pulse pounding crescendos, serene moments of reflection and everything in between are created by, rather than scripted for, the player.",

Instead, the task falls to Beebz, a young demon barely a thousand years old, who decides it\u2019s time for her to kick every turf leader\u2019s butt and become the Demon Queen herself.\n\n\u2022\tA unique aesthetic combining the expressiveness of 2D illustrations with the depth and sense of exploration 3D environments can offer!\n\u2022\tA world chock-full of humor and style, from the music accompanied by the protagonist\u2019s rapping to the colorful characters inhabiting the world!\n\u2022\tA unique take on progression! Take a victory lap and explore previously beaten levels to discover their liberated state, with plenty of mechanical and environmental changes to uncover. Or take some time off in the hub town taking on sidequests and other distinct challenges instead.\n\u2022\tPull off some clever platforming combinations or get physical with a special physics-driven combat system that ramps up the chaos and fun. Push, pull and spin your enemies out of your way.\n\u2022\tA different take on checkpoints, freeing the player to place them wherever they want. Show off without them for a perfect run, or place one in preparation for a challenging section.\n\u2022\tUnique challenges like the \u201cPhoto Hunt\u201d mode where you\u2019re tasked to take pictures of hidden locations & surprising moments! Or simply take pictures and selfies for fun and share them across all social media!\n\u2022\tAn awesome collection of purchasable mods that can be combined in clever ways to completely change your playstyle! Or you could buy some dyes & pets instead, the world's your oyster!\n\u2022\tTons of carefully crafted levels that constantly introduce new challenges as well as engaging bosses full of character and life! Until Beebz gets to them...\n\nFrom the makers of Slime-san comes their newest creation! The team used everything they learned from their 2D platformer to elevate this 3D platformer to the next level!",

Join parkour master Marie Taylor and treasure hunter James Andrew in a historical action thriller, as they unveil the secrets of a forgotten kingdom which has been tragically trapped in and endless time loop. Explore a beautifully hand-drawn non-lineal open world, recover valuable relics, chart a lost island, and gather new clues in every loop to complete an ancient prophecy. Solve the riddles and mysteries that angered the old Gods, on your quest to prevent history from repeating itself forever.\n\nSecrets of the Minoan Cataclysm. In 1639 BC a powerful explosion devastated the Minoan civilization and sunk the birthplace of their empire: the volcanic island of Thera. History seems to repeat itself, as the island has resurfaced, and a new cataclysm is bound to happen. Why were the Minoan so advanced to their time? Did King Minos foresee their demise? Can a new eruption of Thera be stopped? There's only one way to find out!\n\nA sunken island trapped in time. Hidden in the depths for several millennia, the island of Thera is full of historical treasures to collect and mysteries to decipher. Discover a lost Minoan citadel, open your way through an ottoman sunken fleet and unlock the doors to underground palace, as you uncover the details about the folk who lived there and their tragic fate. Exploit a glitch in time to secure information on a persistent map and solve key puzzles before the world blows up and the loop restarts!\n\nTiming, precision and puzzle-solving. Buckle up for an action-packed adventure, as you parkour your way through a rough terrain full of challenges: surf steep slopes, climb high walls, vault over obstacles, swing on vines and jump over deep pits to explore a hand drawn open world. Every corner of the island hides an artifact, a clue or a piece of the puzzle that needs to be solved to save the world from disaster.\n \nYou are not alone on the island... Marie Taylor is the hero of the story, a brilliant treasure hunter who works with her associate, historian James Andrew, seeking out ancient relics. But this time they'll find out they're not the only ones aware of the Minoan scoop, as longtime rivals appear on scene to bring back ghosts from the past and complicate matters further. ",

Build your party and venture forth to discover the secrets behind ancient long abandoned cities and decide where your own morality ultimately lies in this turn-based action strategy game.\n\nCHARACTERS\nPlay as a varied and exciting cast of characters on your adventure through Estera, each with their own abilities and view on each other. As war continues to split the land, will camaraderie conquer all or will personal views rip your team apart?\n\nCOMBAT\nCreate your party from five different classes and dozens of playable characters. Combine hundreds of unique skills to ensure victory and never have the same fight twice as each character features its own upgrade and levelling tree.\n\nSTRATEGY\nCombine abilities to create powerful combos against your foes, or combine defensive abilities to negate the deadliest attacks. Combine burn, freeze, stun, cripple and more to obtain your goals, and use magic and tactics to protect your heroes.\n\nNARRATIVE\nDecide your fate with a deep branching narrative and choice driven decisions. Your actions may lead to an outcome which the world of Estera may not deserve. Should your party feature characters from all sides of the war, opinions may clash - with disastrous consequences.\n\nWORLD\nExplore the stunning world of Estera and breathe in the beautiful hand illustrated locations. Venture deep into murky dangerous woods, roam vibrant busy towns and ransack long forgotten tombs. From the dizzying heights of Tower Of The Ancients to the harsh lands of Arralash, the world is yours to discover.",

        "description": "With departures, arrivals and the continuous hustle and bustle of passengers, there is rarely an opportunity for a break. In Airport Simulator: Day & Night, your challenge is to keep the wheel turning and ensure that everything in the airport runs smoothly around the clock.\n\nFirstly, you will need to take care of fleet and baggage management to handle transporting passengers and the ever-increasing number of aircraft from various airlines. In addition, security checks, airport hygiene and maintenance are also crucial and need to be well managed.\n\nDepending on the time of day and weather conditions, your tasks will vary. For example, in frosty weather, the de-icing of wings becomes the main focus of attention. \nThese are just some of the important parts of running your organization as you compete against other international airport competitors.\n\nGoal-oriented management, satisfied staff, and happy passengers - will you achieve your goals through hard work and commitment? In the beginning, you will take over many tasks yourself. Over time, you will be able to delegate tasks to your airport staff. For now, it is time to roll up your sleeves; in Airport Simulator: Day & Night, there is always something to do!\n\nDay & Night: Manage your airport at any time of the day and make sure everything runs smoothly.\nChanging weather: Safety comes first, and processes need to be followed in any weather condition. E.g. Taking care of de-icing wings.\nManaging the plane: Different types of aircraft all require inspection and cleaning of the interior.\nBusy traffic: Numerous detailed vehicles and aircraft on the huge grounds guarantees a realistic airport experience. Different vehicles can be steered by yourself.\nIntelligent AI and personnel system: Pilots, stewardesses, mechanics, taxiway staff all support you in your tasks. A good organization and overview are the key to success.\nVaried missions: Tasks such as de-icing, loading and unloading the aircraft, refuelling, transport and cleaning are just some of your extensive activities.\nRealism: Every action requires a reaction. Damage to vehicles or sick employees - everything is simulated.",

But that's not all: Monster Camp comes with other new twists here and there, from the campfire mechanics to a new stage full of magic mixed drinks.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all! The XXL version includes ALL of the non-Kickstarter exclusive outfit packs! \n\nWe're taking the best parts of the popular \"Monster Prom\" formula, but adding some new spice to it. You will see ;)",

Aided by the undead Necro-Chef Simmer, you must stay safe, get fed, find a way to get out.\n\nDungeon Munchies is a side-scrolling action RPG with a focus on hunting down creatures, cooking them, and eating dishes to gain certain abilities. The combination of dishes you choose to eat will impact your entire play style.\n\nBig Menu for a Big Stomach\nWith a stomach that can only take seven dishes, you must put together a meal that maximises your abilities. Guava juice, grilled shrimp, or crab stirfry may mean the difference between health recovery, damage output or a watery shield.\n\nTools of the Trade\nCraft all kinds of deadly weapons out of the animal and plant parts you can't eat. Pair them with your favorite dishes to create the most overpowered combat combo.\n\nFarm-fresh & Locally-sourced\nIn this day and age, ingredients are hard to come by. You should be prepared to face off electrical snails, razor-sharp shrimp claws, and laser wasps to get the delicious parts you need.\n\nSomething Doesn\u2019t Feel Right...\nFrom the self-professed-AAA-license-holding necro-chef, to the diabolical voodoo \u201cLord of the Forest\u201d, to the radical revolutionaries of the fruit revolution, everyone wants you to do their thing, but no one's really right in the head.

It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. \n\nThe first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. \nOnce you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.",

        "description": "Immerse into the fantastical world of imagination.\n\nIn Aery - Dreamscape you play as a bird-like spirit who can enter the minds of other people in order to explore their thoughts, their secrets, and their imagination.\n\nEach person has their own imaginary world and each world represents the thoughts, fears, and ambitions of that person in an interesting and mostly abstract way. \n\nWithin an imaginary world, you have to find a certain amount of memory shards to advance with the story and to get to know more about the person in question. Once you have found all memory shards you are free to leave the world again and search for the next mind you want to explore. \n\nTherefore every single imagination world acts as its own small story with its very own theme, design elements, and obstacles.\n\nExperience the feeling of flying, immerse into beautiful and atmospheric landscapes and enjoy the unique storytelling of the game while getting to know a lot of interesting people on the way.",

Use powerful weapons and spells to break through hordes of enemies and explore laberynthine dungeons in this hectic roguelite FPS, while you improve your skills and discover new equipment. Will you be up to the task?\n\nEvil lurks in the depths\n\nAs a member of the most powerful magic order, your task is to protect humanity from the forces of evil. Face hordes of enemies and fearsome Guardians in epic and dynamic combats. Keep an eye on elemental resistances and vulnerabilities to maximize your efficiency, and earn experience to level up and learn useful perks that will help you reach the end of the dungeon in one piece.\n\nFirst Person Shooting at its finest!\n\nZiggurat 2 focuses on fast paced combat and constant movement, in which mistakes are paid dearly. You'll need dexterity, reflexes and resource management skills to have a chance of survival against the dangers hiding in the shadows, and manage to come back safe and sound.\n\nNo two plays are the same\n\nFollowing the line of its predecessor, in Ziggurat 2 dungeons are randomly generated, full of dangers and treasure for the bold wizards daring to enter them. Going a step further, dungeons now have more verticality and variety, and more compact rooms, for quicker fights and easier exploration.\n\nBack to the Citadel\n\nIn the Citadel, home of the Brotherhood, you'll be able to recruit new and old allies, as well as improve your equipment and skills, before deciding which mission to perform next. With dozens of unlockable weapons with different natures and behaviors, preparation before a mission is crucial and may be the difference between an overwhelming victory and the bitter taste of defeat.\n\nImproved formula\n\nZiggurat 2 has been redesigned from the ground up with the goal of improving over the original in all areas, and offer an even smoother and faster experience, with quicker, more intense sessions, and more interactive and fulfilling progression.",

Fox can fit through small areas that Nuna can't reach, scramble up walls, and jump to great heights.\n\nBrave the harsh world of the Arctic \u2014 Run under, through, and atop the unstable structures of an abandoned coastal village. Explore the eerily quiet treetops of a mysterious, frozen forest. Brave the fierce winds of the eternal blizzard. Only with the aid of Helping Spirits will Nuna and Fox have any chance of survival in a land where survival seems impossible.\n\nUnlock fascinating video insights \u2014 Elders, storytellers, and other members of the Alaska Native community share stories and wisdom about their culture, values and the amazing Arctic world encountered by players in over 30 minutes of interviews.  \n\nThe Never Alone: Arctic Collection on Nintendo Switch\u2122 also contains the Foxtales DLC at no additional cost!",

Strange customers? Yes. Over the top crafting challenges? You bet. A shop cat? Absolutely! Take ownership of Merek\u2019s Market as you haggle, barter and craft your way through a comical single player campaign or team up with friends to supply the whole town.\n\nCraft\n\nDo you have the skill and craftsmanship to make beautiful artisanal items? Neither does Merek but putting a few items on a crafting table and hitting them with a hammer seem to turn up decent results.\n\nHaggle\n\nSkilfully negotiate your way into heady profits. Unethical side note, richer folk will pay through the nose for any product. Do with that information what you will.\n\nBosses\n\nBattle absurd bosses and craft custom items for them. If you can't manage that then at least try your best to keep your shop in one piece.\n\n4 Player Local Co-op\n\n- Can't invite your friends round? You can play with your parents who will most definitely quickly grasp the controls and be useful team mates.\n- Has the spark gone? Save the relationship with some quality time together.\n- Do you struggle with the most basic of video games? Look like you\u2019re doing something useful while your 3 friends carry you.",

Find a hat that truly speaks to you (and try not to lose it in the rush of battle). Pick a paint job that makes your heart sing.\n\nFOUR ARENAS\nRanging from a peaceful stony outcropping to a deadly lava lair, pick an arena that will challenge you and your friends.\n\nTEAM UP\nPlay against some rather friendly or vicious AI; great for blowing off steam or getting some practice in.",

He needs them. At any cost. Deciding to record his journey to another world with the Grim Reaper, he hopes he can create the most trending, most liked, most hyped video of all time.\n\nUnfortunately for Angelo, that world is Hell. And it\u2019s inhabited by people with more than a few problems, who will need his help.\n\nMake a visit to the Devil himself! But be careful because... well\u2026you'll see.\n\nIn Hell, Angelo won\u2019t be traveling alone. Even a blogger needs a sidekick. \n\nWhat you can expect:\n\u2022 Expressive and somehow slightly familiar characters\n\u2022 A helluva great looking game with lots of levels, but no pixel art!\n\u2022 Addictive and mind-blowing puzzles. This game makes you think (unlike other games)!\n\u2022 Not pixel art graphics! (in case you missed the line above)\n\u2022 Funny dialogue. A cocktail of humor and philosophy; delivered in snappy soundbites! \n\u2022 Too much cocktails are harmful, so our lines are sophisticated. Making you smile and think at the same time by using only a few words (like now)\n\u2022 You won\u2019t forget these characters\u2019 lines, even if you try. Each character has their own issues. (Who doesn\u2019t have issues, right?)\n\u2022 WARNING!!! There is a chance you\u2019ll like it in Hell and won\u2019t be scared anymore",

        "description": "Welcome to Elk is a biographical adventure set on an island like no other, where every character you encounter has a story to tell. From the weird and wonderful to the dark and desperate, all the tales told on Elk are based on true stories of life on the road less traveled.\n\nTales of real stories\nWelcome to Elk, an adventure game set on a fictional island stitched together with true stories and tall tales, and inhabited by the people who lived them.\n\nStory\nYou play as Frigg, a young carpenter trading their busy life in the city for an apprenticeship in a small town. When she arrives in Elk, Frigg worries that the slower pace of life will be boring (they don\u2019t even have the internet), but quickly discovers nothing could be further from the truth!\n\nTragic stories told with love and sometimes humour\nThe stories reflect the drama of our lives, on Elk it\u2019s known that humour, love and death go hand in hand. Life may seem hard sometimes, but it is always followed by laughter.\n\nMake new friends\nOn Elk, you will meet weird and wonderful characters - people whom the world has either ignored or forgotten. Follow their ups and downs, their odd drinking rituals and their unique ways of tackling whatever life throws at them.\n\nUnique mini games \nHelp your new friends on Elk through playful mini games. All games are uniquely tailored to underline the story and the mood of the game.\n\nMeet the people who told the original stories\nWe value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and share them. That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who inspired us to make this game.\n\nHow we used true stories in the game?\nTrue stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have dealt with it in Welcome to Elk:\nThe stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative. Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of originally and only us who designed it will ever know \u2013 or come close to the real truth of the stories.\n\nWelcome to Elk might look like a \u201cfun\u201d game but it\u2019s about telling stories \u2013 some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand.",

There are tricky clients who interact with each other, interfere with the Reaper's work, or ignore the basic rules, which means you'll have to be extra careful when you're deciding where to send almost everyone.\n\nClients\nMany clients are unique individuals. Some of them are even a little famous - but any resemblance to actual people is totally, entirely coincidental. They're not just unique faces, though - they also have unique abilities. For example, Jailers won't let you send prisoners anywhere, Bureaucrats will surprise you with inspections, and the Musketeers are one for all and all for one!\n\nThe Reapers Union\nThis is where the Reaper goes after every work day just to go to work again! But first you can accept contracts, view jobs from the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, get the latest news from this world, and do super important favors for other Union members. After all, every candidate needs faithful friends when there's an upcoming election.\n\nHorsemen of the Apocalypse\nNow that the Union is up and running, the Horsemen finally have time to devote to their beloved side projects. Death's Agency, War's Arena, Pestilence's Laboratory, and Famine's Diner are all open for business!\n\nAnything else?\nCatastrophes, a rental apartment, a bunch more events, laughs, and maybe even cats. You'll definitely get to do some fishing and listen to awesome music.\n\nGood luck, Mr. Master Reaper!",

Can you overcome the mechanical menace and secure your right to rule the forest?\n\nIntroduces Co-op Play! Team up to take on powerful automated opponents!\n\nMechanical Marquise 2.0\nThis is the simplest of the bots and can be used to fill out the player count in dozens of configurations. Though this bot is straightforward, don\u2019t get complacent. At least one player will need to keep it in check!\n\nElectrical Eyrie\nThe Electric Eyrie will inspire fear in the most stalwart of players. Like the Eyrie Dynasties, this bot can ramp up its action potential aggressively.\n\nAutomated Alliance\nThe Automated Alliance is especially zealous and will revolt frequently. Keep in mind their potential targets so you avoid any unpleasant surprises. Once they do establish a foothold, timing is critical. Don\u2019t let them consolidate their warriors or you\u2019ll be in trouble!\n\nVagabot\nThe Vagabot makes for a capricious friend or foe. Like a human player, he will reward those who craft items. But be careful, he can make for a dangerous enemy once he gets enough items to boost his maximum hits.",

        "description": "Join Lottie\u2019s Paradise Planning team and travel to a distant group of beautiful resort islands with a diverse set of landscapes. This time, you are in charge of inviting characters as clients and helping them live out their own dream vacations. Choose from a variety of islands, with different terrain and climates and find one that matches your client\u2019s vision. Then start designing and start making their vacation dreams come true. Just wait until you see the look on your clients\u2019 faces after you reveal the vacation home decorated just for them.\n\nAdd personalized touches to your client\u2019s resort island\n\nCustomize everything from home exteriors and interiors, the yard and even customize the weather to either be sunny or rainy. Handpick the picture-book spot for your resort creation and use the Paradise Planning team\u2019s expansive inventory to deck out vacation homes without being limited to your own inventory, recipes, or resources. The editing tools make decorating a snap! It\u2019s a breeze to go back and redecorate as you like, so change and rearrange to your heart\u2019s content.  \n\nAs you design more vacation homes for your clients, facilities like a caf\u00e9 and a school around the Paradise Planning office will open up. Decorate these into inviting locales, choose roles for different characters, then watch your clients spend time together. Why not stop by and check in to see how things are going in paradise?\n\nYou can up your design game on your own island, too! Design options that you acquire while working as a Paradise Planning team member can be used on your island as they become available. Build partition walls and pillars, set the mood with lighting, and add soundscapes to both your residents\u2019 homes as well as your own.\n\nShare your masterpieces with friends\n\nTake in-game photos of your designs and add them to your portfolio. Share the photos with other players using the in-game Showroom* in the Happy Home Network app and they can tour your personally-designed resort islands or go tour theirs for some relaxation and inspiration.

        "description": "Paratopic Deluxe Edition brings the horror with you - play the game or enjoy the atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nYou got caught smuggling VHS tapes across the border, and now there's hell to pay. You want to find an elusive rare bird in the forest and snap its picture. You have to kill a man in the back room of a shady diner.\n\nThis is Paratopic, an experimental first-person horror game named by Rock, Paper, Shotgun as one of the best games of 2018, and by FACT mag as having one of the top 10 soundtracks of the year.\n\n\u2022 A narrative-driven horror-tinged adventure game that takes you on a journey through a cruel fever dream world.\n\n\u2022 Cut between numerous detailed and varied vignettes to unravel how the stories of three separate characters intersect.\n\n\u2022 Explore the detritus of forbidden industry, kill, drive through the night, find yourself in conversation with some very off-kilter individuals.\n\n\u2022 A leisurely playthrough should take forty-five minutes, give or take, with plenty more to discover in the detailed, grimy low polygon environments. Or speedrun it, if you'd prefer.\n\n\u2022 Over an hour of gorgeous dark ambient music is used to create our subtly dynamic soundscape. An anachronistic blend of modern and outdated production as glitches and textural pads meet synthesis & sampling akin to 1990s Unreal Engine soundtracks.\n\n\u2022 Playable both in TV and handheld mode, experience a critically acclaimed short-form masterpiece at home or on the go. Take the horror with you.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\u201cParatopic sticks with you. It's the kind of game that lingers, haunting the dark corners of your mind after its credits roll. There's something off about it in a delightful way; the atmospheric fever dream of low-poly horror imagery shows, but never tells.\u201d\nDestructoid\n\n\u201cParatopic\u2018s city is a sooty husk, a ruin whose scarce inhabitants eke out day-to-day existence by taking dangerous smuggling jobs, murdering for money, or reconfiguring their flesh in agonized cathode-ray rapture.\u201d\nHeterotopias\n\n\u201cParatopic is a short first-person horror game which draws ideas from Thirty Flights Of Loving but takes them somewhere terrible, leading them down an alley and through an unmarked door into a world which looks a bit like ours but just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nAWARDS\n\nExcellence in Audio Winner 2019\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nNuovo Award Nominee\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nExcellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nThe Best PC Games of 2018 So Far\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nFavourite Games of 2018\nAVClub\n\nThe 10 Best Video Game Soundtracks of 2018\nFACT mag\n\nBest Horror Games of 2018\nBloody Disgusting",

        "description": "Graveyard Keeper is the most inaccurate medieval cemetery management sim of the year. Build & manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",
