        "description": "At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.\n\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO: TV EDITION is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.\n\nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the TV Edition collects all five acts along with the \"interludes\", which were originally published separately, available now on Nintendo Switch\u2122 for the first time. Also for the first time, it has been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).",

A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts?

Welcome to the world of Shift Happens - the only game out there which doesn't take a closer look at the body mass index and where players are actually forced to work together (and occasionally stab each other in the back).\n\nExperience thrilling adventures in four totally different worlds:\n\u25cf\tExplore a freaked out laboratory where Bismo and Plom had their accident!\n\u25cf\t Uncover the secrets of the overgrown green forests...\n\u25cf\t... and survive the dry canyons where a deadly wind awaits you\u2026\n\u25cf\t... just to prepare you for the bitingly cold caves!\n\nThe twist: Shift Happens is pure fun for solo players, yet its full potential can only be experienced together. Play it with your best friend while hanging around on a couch enjoying a pizza. Together you can solve puzzles and fight over precious coins. Coordination and communication are key to a successful journey. We recommend using gamepads for maximum enjoyability.\n\nThe game also features a singleplayer mode with different level content. Although the game is primarily meant to be played by two people, you can play the completely different singleplayer levels without another person.\n\nThe game features all the good things you should expect from a co-op platformer:\n\n\u25cf\tOver 40 levels of handcrafted fun\n\u25cf\tLocal co-op gameplay\n\u25cf\tExtra challenges/rewards in the levels for completionists and explorers\n\u25cf\tMore than 30 different levels designed for the singleplayer mode\n\u25cf\t8 unlockable bonuslevels (4 single- & 4 multiplayer)\n\u25cf\tAnd timechallenges for each level",

        "description": "\u201cDream Alone has a simple premise and a big atmosphere, with a background design that is genuinely chilling and puzzles that will make you think.\u201d 8/10, Pure Nintendo\n\nDream Alone is a 2D platforming game with classic platform gameplay, deadly traps, a dark storyline and unique hero abilities. \n\nA mysterious sickness strikes a quiet village. One by one the townspeople fall into a coma, entire families falling prey to a death-like state. When the hero\u2019s family becomes affected by the disease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, Lady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even reverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a battlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own alternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a few more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, the player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and some very dark secrets. \n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant death. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some traps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, need to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to move or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which are rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. In some cases the hero can even create a clone of himself! \n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the different realities you may yet find lady death.",

Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

Meet cute characters, steal their trash, and throw them in a hole.\n\nWhere Trash is Treasure\nRaccoons have taken over Donut County with remote-controlled trash-stealing holes. You play as BK, a hole-driving raccoon who swallows up his friends and their homes to earn idiotic prizes. \n\nWhen BK falls into one of his own holes, he\u2019s confronted by his best friend Mira and the residents of Donut County, who are all stuck 999 feet underground\u2026 and they demand answers!\n\nThe Hole Keeps Growing\n\u2022 EXPLORE every character\u2019s home, each with their own unique environment.\n\u2022 MOVE the hole to swallow up their stuff, growing bigger each time.\n\u2022 COMBINE objects inside for crazy effects: cook soup, breed bunnies, launch fireworks, and more.\n\u2022 CATAPULT things back out of the hole. You can use it to solve puzzles...or just destroy stuff.\n\u2022 DEVOUR everything. The hole won\u2019t stop until the whole county is all gone.\n \nDonut County was created by Ben Esposito, designer on What Remains of Edith Finch and The Unfinished Swan. It is the result of six years of solo development, dozens of donuts (for research), and one fateful encounter with a raccoon.\n",

Follow the software instructions to download the floor plan maps and print them out.\n\nStory\nYou are a new employee at a real estate agency. Apparently in this city, there are many properties with ghosts living in them! In Madorica Real Estate, you have to search for the only property that doesn\u2019t have ghosts in the entire city.\n\nYour job requires you to exorcise the ghosts in each room so that the new owners can live there in peace. Hints to beating the ghosts can be found around the rooms and from Mr. Madorica. If you use the hints to solve the puzzles and input the commands, even a newbie real estate agent like you can use magic!\n\nSearch for hints, jot down notes on your floor plan maps, and seek out magic to exorcise all the ghosts!",

He is part of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal mountains of trash.

Rufus decides to help the young woman out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty which limits his usual unscrupulousness.\n\nHelp Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl from heaven. Only with this rich girl from his dreams he might be able to escape Deponia and, unexpectedly, to save the planet.\n\n\u2022 Unique comic style with hand-drawn HD resolution 2D graphics\n\n\u2022 Bizarre characters and wacky humor\n\n\u2022 Challenging puzzles and hours of dialogue\n\n",

        "description": "More chaos, more destruction, more Rufus. Not one, not two, but three Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure comedy Goodbye Deponia!\n\nThe Organon plans the destruction of Deponia, the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just can't seem to stop getting in his own way.\n\nAll inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society. Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for, still seems to be the key to his endeavor...and to the elevator that will get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect plan.\n\nAnd yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing. When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament. But an \"\"inexplicable\"\" error causes complications and Goal slips from our hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon.\n\nThree problems that only three Rufuses could solve \u2013 and thus, the luckless inventor decides to clone himself! This leads to crazy ramifications for the player: In Goodbye Deponia, the player occasionally needs to control all three Rufuses, using them to complete tasks together \u2013 despite Rufus stumbling over himself so often.\n\n\nA classic point & click adventure in a unique world, in the tradition of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Matt Groening\n\nUnique comic style with hand-drawn HD 2D graphics\n\nCutscenes set to music with lovingly realized animations",

        "description": "With this long-expected sequel to the critically highly acclaimed and lavishly praised Deponia, the player enters round two. Chaos on Deponia turns out to be even wackier than its predecessor and instantly puts the player under its spell.\n\nAfter the events on Deponia, it seems that Rufus came to his senses. He's grown prudent, amicable, kind and caring, without any intention to cause major mayhem just to further his own selfish ends. It seems he is far from chaining himself to flaming saw blades, training torpedo-dolphins or foraging through platypus nests. Or is he?\n\nUltimately it's a flaming saw blade grounding Goal on Deponia again. By accident, her consciousness gets split into three parts and stored to three different discs.\nNow it's on Rufus once again to convince all three parts of Goal, utilizing his remarkable charming wits, to become one again, venture to Elysium with her and save Deponia from certain doom while he's at it.\n\nThe second adventure on Deponia tells a unique, self-contained story playable without further knowledge of the first installment. Fans of the first game discover new aspects of familiar characters' backgrounds and see open questions answered.\n\nUnique world honoring the tradition of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and Matt Groening.\n\nHand-drawn art design in full HD glory and high-quality cartoon animation drawn in comic style.\n\nBizarre characters and wacky humor meet challenging puzzles.\n\nElaborate soundtrack with many atmospheric tracks.",

        "description": "Life at the convent school isn't easy for Lilli. Only her vivid imagination lets the shy girl escape everyday-drudgery under the stern, watchful eye of the Mother Superior. She diligently works through her chores, no matter how unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any resentment, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable shell of sweetness.\nAnd if anything goes awry or gets ugly, the jolly censorship gnomes got her back: they put a nice coat of pink paint over all the things Lili would rather not consciously confront. But are her little potato-shaped budies real or just a figment of her vivid subconscious? Maybe it's only a matter of time until she completely loses her mind!\nWhen her best friend Edna disappears under mysterious circumstances, Lili bravely sets out on a dangerous journey, not only to get her friend back, but also to confront her subconscious fears.",

Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.\n\nThe gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.\n\nUltimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\n\nCreated by Giant Sparrow, the team behind the first-person painting game The Unfinished Swan.",

        "description": "Ashen is an open world co-op action RPG about a wanderer in search of a place to call home. \n\nPassive Co-Op Multiplayer\nAs you adventure through Ashen, you'll occasionally encounter other players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them.\n \nSouls with a Twist\nAshen is faithful to the \"souls\" genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here\u2019s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you\u2019re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it.\n \nCreatures + Combat\nAshen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences.\n \nCrafting is Key\nAs you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.\n \nStory + Score\nFamed fantasy author Mark Lawrence (The Broken Empire trilogy) and renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the development team at Aurora44 to craft a cohesive and unique narrative and sound.",

        "description": "Enter the Wrath-a-Thon, a fiendish challenge created by the evil sorcerer Thoth-Amon to trap the heroes of Hyboria. Crush, kill and maim your enemies with an arsenal of savage weapons as you and your friends take on the minions of evil. Upgrade your village, upgrade your skills and upgrade yourself (seriously, this game will make you a better person).\n\nConan Chop Chop is the most epic and realistic stick figure game ever to be set in the world of Conan the Barbarian. Discover a delightfully savage world full of epic boss fights, perilous dungeons, and endless amounts of loot and item combinations. \n\n\nONLINE AND COUCH CO-OP \nWhile you can choose to save the world solo, Conan Chop Chop really puts the party in \"party game\" when you step into its multiplayer mayhem. Featuring 1-4 player online and couch co-op, you can choose to play by yourself, with friends, or random people as you save the world from damnation. \n\nUNIQUE CAST OF HEROES \nWant to get up close and personal, or shoot your opponents from afar? Choose from a cast consisting of the most famous heroes in Hyboria, from the sword-swinging Conan to the bow-bending B\u00ealit. Chop, shoot, or simply blast your foes into tiny bits. \n\nLEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTERS \nIn Conan Chop Chop, what kills you also makes you stronger. Use the experience you earn from each run to unlock character-specific perks and abilities to conquer the enemies that defeated you. \nBuild the skill tree for each one of the characters and discover their unique builds. \n\nTRILLIONS OF ITEM COMBOS \nAcquire new skills as you venture to the far reaches of the world, looting magical charms, weapons, and armors. Experiment with different item combinations to discover potentially overpowered abilities and new ways to play. \n\nMAGICALLY GENERATED WORLD \nNo two runs through Conan Chop Chop are the same, thanks to procedurally generated maps and dungeon layouts. Discover new shops, challenges and treasures with every playthrough. \n\nRUTHLESS BOSS FIGHTS \nTest your might against unique dungeon bosses, such as The Giant Sand Worm of Koth and The Frost Giant of Vanaheim. Some bosses may even roam the wilderness, guarding golden chests, powerful artifacts, and other riches.",

        "description": "Spoiled harvest goddess Sakuna finds herself banished from her opulent celestial home to an island overrun with demons. In the untamed wilderness, she must rediscover her birthright as the daughter of a warrior god and harvest goddess by weathering the elements, fighting monsters, and cultivating rice, the source of her power. By her side in this forbidding place is her guardian Tama and a group of outcast humans. Together, these unlikely companions must join hands to tame both the soil and the demons of Hinoe Island.\n\nDeveloped by Edelweiss, the indie team behind the acclaimed Astebreed, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin combines side-scrolling action with deep crafting and rice cultivation in a powerful tale about finding one's place in the world.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Refined Side-scrolling Platforming Action\nUsing farm tools as weapons, chain together quick, heavy, and special attacks to take down demonic beasts, while mastering the magical \u201cdivine raiment\u201d will be essential to grapple distant platforms, evade danger, and overcome powerful enemies.\n \n- Detailed 3D Simulation-style Gameplay\nLearn the ancient art of agriculture by following detailed steps from planting to harvesting to cultivate the perfect crop. As a harvest goddess, Sakuna\u2019s strength grows with each rice crop, with attributes such as aesthetic and flavor directly correlating to her combat abilities. \n \n- Creating a Home in the Wilderness\nSakuna\u2019s mortal companions make weapons, armor, and meals for her using the materials and ingredients she gathers on her adventures, and completing quests for them will unlock even more options.\n \n- A Fresh Take on Japanese Mythology\nThe heroine is part of a pantheon of gods and demons inspired by traditional Japanese mythology but featuring many unique twists. The story and world are filled with lovingly rendered details, some familiar and some completely original.",

The game combines point & click gameplay with unique magic skills.\n\nSadja, a Southern princess, has an unstoppable desire to become the greatest hero in history \u2013 by joining and succeeding in the biggest war Aventuria has ever seen: The war of the Mages, fought in the middle of an uninhabitable desert.\nBird catcher Geron lives almost 450 years after the Great War. Geron\u2019s eternal love, Nuri, has been turned into a crow by an evil curse. To give her back her human form, Geron needs the help of the mysterious merchant Fahi, who has magical powers. But Fahi is only willing to help Geron if he agrees to solve a puzzle which Fahi has seen in his dreams. The quest for answers soon leads to a chain of events that connects both Sadja's and Geron's stories, threatening to turn the present into a grim reflection of a long forgotten past.\n\nMemoria combines classic point & click adventure gameplay with the features of The Dark Eye, one of the most successful RPG universes known in the fantasy world. Point & click adventure game puzzles get a unique twist by adding magical features \u2013 and a wise, talking staff. Over eight chapters, players control both Sadja\u2019s and Geron\u2019s fates, involuntarily interacting with each other and bridging over 500 years of time. Each chapter in Memoria features opulent graphics, epic locations, a thrilling fantasy crime story and a unique puzzle design that differs from chapter to chapter.\n\n\u2022 Epic fantasy soundtrack and high quality voiceover to draw you deep into the game\n\u2022 Dive into the world of The Dark Eye, and explore mystical places such as Draconia, an ancient temple built by dragons\n\u2022 Follow the story of two unique characters through two different time periods\n\u2022 Beautifully hand-drawn 2D backgrounds and high quality 3D game characters\n\u2022 From the creator of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, The Whispered World and Deponia",

The main essence of the game is research locations and puzzles, plunging in the dramatic story of a little girl suffering from asthma.\n\nThe main character - Sasha Anders, a thirteen year old girl who awakens from a nightmare. The world seems to be upside down for her. Everything becomes so strange. The house is imbued with loneliness and longing and it seems strange to our character considering it was always dominated by love and harmony. Everywhere except for the heroine's room, suspiciously darkens, without even a single sound. Her parents and younger brother have gone missing. The girl is smart and sensible beyond her years, but each person has their own fears, and sometimes they cannot cope. This is especially troubling Sasha, due to the slightest fear, she feels suffocated.\n\nThe story that we'll tell you penetrates deep in your heart and leaves the experience forever. The saddest part of this mystical tale, is that it is not a tale at all. This is the story of a little girl, the story of Sasha Anders.\n",

In Land of Screens, guide Holland on her new mission to ditch the social media saturation and discover some real-world relationships by enlisting the help of a few new friends, some synthy chiptune jams, and the inimitable chemistry of small children and adorable animals.\n\nA Point-And-Click Adventure of Internet Escapism\n\nPut on your fanciest mingling cap to conquer harrowingly familiar challenges such as:\n\u2022 Navigating an impromptu party where your only choices of company are strangers\u2014or worse: friends you haven\u2019t seen since high school.\n\u2022 Meandering through a hotel lobby to force awkward introductions with fellow attendees of a professional conference.\n\u2022 Making the best of last-minute concert plans where you\u2019ve never heard of the band, been to the venue, or met any of the people you\u2019re there with.\n\u2022 Family. Reunions.\n\u2022 Getting your friends excited about doing nature stuff so they can convince other people to start doing nature stuff so you can all spend the day doing nature stuff.\n\nJust Get Everyone to Stop Looking at their Phones\u2026 No Problem.\n\nNo matter where Holland goes to try and get away, everyone is glued to their screens. She\u2019ll need the help of old friends and new acquaintances\u2014and they\u2019ll need help from her\u2014to dodge the online madness and finally unplug for a while. By diving (or stumbling) into fresh experiences, new relationships, and accidental adventures, Holland might just stand a fighting chance of escaping the ever-present creep of social media drama.\n\nRemember How Nice it is to Talk at People\u2019s Actual Faces?\n\nIn a world stuck on digital connections, the only way Holland is going to get through this breakup with her sanity intact is to go analog. Fortunately, she\u2019ll soon learn just how many enticing adventures are out there, away from the continuous social media commentary. Sure, she could obsess over an online thread of opinions about her breakup like everyone normally would, but maybe there\u2019s another way\u2026",

You have to kill a man in the back room of a shady diner.\n\nThis is Paratopic, an experimental first-person horror game named by Rock, Paper, Shotgun as one of the best games of 2018, and by FACT mag as having one of the top 10 soundtracks of the year.\n\n\u2022 A narrative-driven horror-tinged adventure game that takes you on a journey through a cruel fever dream world.\n\n\u2022 Cut between numerous detailed and varied vignettes to unravel how the stories of three separate characters intersect.\n\n\u2022 Explore the detritus of forbidden industry, kill, drive through the night, find yourself in conversation with some very off-kilter individuals.\n\n\u2022 A leisurely playthrough should take forty-five minutes, give or take, with plenty more to discover in the detailed, grimy low polygon environments. Or speedrun it, if you'd prefer.\n\n\u2022 Over an hour of gorgeous dark ambient music is used to create our subtly dynamic soundscape. An anachronistic blend of modern and outdated production as glitches and textural pads meet synthesis & sampling akin to 1990s Unreal Engine soundtracks.\n\n\u2022 Playable both in TV and handheld mode, experience a critically acclaimed short-form masterpiece at home or on the go. Take the horror with you.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\u201cParatopic sticks with you. It's the kind of game that lingers, haunting the dark corners of your mind after its credits roll. There's something off about it in a delightful way; the atmospheric fever dream of low-poly horror imagery shows, but never tells.\u201d\nDestructoid\n\n\u201cParatopic\u2018s city is a sooty husk, a ruin whose scarce inhabitants eke out day-to-day existence by taking dangerous smuggling jobs, murdering for money, or reconfiguring their flesh in agonized cathode-ray rapture.\u201d\nHeterotopias\n\n\u201cParatopic is a short first-person horror game which draws ideas from Thirty Flights Of Loving but takes them somewhere terrible, leading them down an alley and through an unmarked door into a world which looks a bit like ours but just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nAWARDS\n\nExcellence in Audio Winner 2019\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nNuovo Award Nominee\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nExcellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nThe Best PC Games of 2018 So Far\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nFavorite Games of 2018\nAVClub\n\nThe 10 Best Video Game Soundtracks of 2018\nFACT mag\n\nBest Horror Games of 2018\nBloody Disgusting",

        "description": "Battles\nThis game is a unique mix of rogue-like with dungeon exploration, RPG, turn-based tactics and collectible card game. At the base of the turn-based system are not turns, but time. Find and improve new heroes and get coins to buy new spells. But remember, a hero\u2019s death will be fatal.\n\nHeroes\nEvery hero has a special perk and a spell, in addition to the three stats (strength, dexterity, endurance). Gather your team of heroes, come up with unique tactics for battles. Traditional Tank, Healer and Warrior? Or would you only use brute force?\nDuring battles, the pre-selected 20 cards with spells are mixed into the deck. Every 6 seconds of combat you take a new card into your hand. During the normal turn, you will have a choice of actions:\n- Normal attack;\n- Defense;\n- Position change;\n- Casting a hero's spell (one for each);\n- Casting spells from hand\n\nEach spell, be it heroic or from a deck has its own mana cost. \n\nMana is shared by all heroes and accumulates during battle. The player will have to choose which spell to use now, because there may not be enough mana for the next one.\n\nDungeons\nSend your heroes to the most dangerous adventure \u2014 Dungeons of Nexoria. Randomly generated floors with a boss at the end of each. Not everyone will be able to return, but those who can will gain great glory!\n\nEvents\nExploration of dungeons is fraught not only with crowds of enemies that need to be destroyed, but also random events and traps, the outcome of which could be fatal.",

        "description": "Logic Puzzle Collection is a puzzle game that offers three distinct styles of logic puzzles. In the Sudoku mode, the player is tasked to fill out a 9 x 9 field with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, each column and each 3 x 3 sub-field contains exactly one occurance of each of the numbers 1 to 9. \n\nPermudoku is a variation of the classic Sudoku puzzle, where instead of numbers, colours have to be placed on a 9 x 9 in such a way that each colour appears exactly once in each column, row and 3 x 3 sub-field. However, from the beginning, all fields are already coloured, the player's task is to swap fields around until the colours are distributed correctly. Both game modes include five different degrees of difficulty with 100 puzzles each, for a total of 1000 puzzles. \n\nFinally,  In Nonodoku, it is the aim of the player to produce a pixel image using the number hints. The player is presented with a grid of white boxes. Numbers on the side and atop indicate how many boxes need to be coloured black in a row. Each number signifies one continuous line of black boxes, between the black boxes for two successive numbers, at least one space must remain white.",

        "description": "Together, they\u2019re the Freelance Police. And they\u2019re about to save the world.\n\nIn 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.\n\nNow everyone\u2019s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.\n \nIt\u2019s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the \u201cspinny thing\u201d they do with their eyes.)\n \nWho\u2019s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam\u2019s nose for detective work, Max\u2019s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max\u2019s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.\n\nReturn to the adventure game that was once called \u201cgaming\u2019s first sitcom\u201d and is today known as \u201cthe remaster you didn\u2019t know you were waiting for.\u201d With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con\u2122 and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN\u2019s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch\u2122 library.\n",

        "description": "A NOT TOO CASUAL BIKE GAME\n\nElasto Mania (commonly known as Elma) is an indie motorbike simulation game, a colorful 2D racing experience first released in 2000 as a successor to Action SuperCross. The remastered version is bigger & better than the original - the definitive way to play. This gem is challenging to master, but you will quickly get the hang of it, once you start playing!\n\nA NEVERENDING EXPERIENCE\n\nThere is always something new to discover when it comes to this beloved enduro platformer. When you think you have completed all the levels and collected all the goodies, it\u2019s time to go online and compete on the leaderboards, or play together with a friend for a new perspective on old levels. And don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t run out of content - there are more than a hundred additional levels in this version, with even more on the way.\n\nA CULT CLASSIC\n\nThe days of floppy disks, CRT monitors and dial-up internet are long gone, but our old school favorite outlived them all - and it\u2019s still going strong. A lot has happened in the past two decades, but this fully formed cult classic is still the same \u201chard, but casual, but hard\u201d retro game we all love. Play it now in its best form!",

        "description": "Generations after the collapse, its surviving descendants have chosen you to become The Bellwielder of the magical Audros Bell. Go forth, battle monsters, solve puzzles, and restore Anuchard to its former skyward glory! \n\nAnuchard was known as a place of wonder and peace, a land of limitless bounty suspended in the heavens above. Five ancient Guardians gave the island their blessings... Until one day they left without a word. The Anuchardian paradise fell from the skies, crashing onto the world below. Only a tiny speck of an island survived the fall. The rest has been coalesced underground into a twisted mass of winding passages full of wild magic and vicious monsters, known simply as The Dungeon.\n\nGenerations passed as few survivors eked out an existence in the Orchard, the sole village on the surviving island, which maintains  the few remains of Anuchardian magic. Farmers tend to the fields while scavengers pick through the bones of the kingdom. \n\nAll await the Chosen One, the Bellwielder, who will take up the Audros Bell and enter the Dungeon, wake the Guardians from their slumber, and bring back paradise.\n\nBe judged worthy and take up the mantle of the Bellwielder. The Dungeon awaits!\n\nThe Bell Tolls\n\nFor everyone and everything. You are the Bellwielder and the Audros Bell is your best friend.\n\nMaster the Bell! Not just as a weapon, but as a most vital tool for overcoming puzzles and obstacles.\n\nA bell can be more than just a blunt instrument of mayhem. Use its knock-back ability to smash enemies into obstacles, reposition them, and clear the way forward.\n\nSolve challenges throughout the Dungeon with the Bell. Launch projectiles, move puzzle pieces, and utilize them creatively!\n\nEnter the Dungeon\n\nThe warped, magical Dungeon houses the Guardians needed to restore the lost kingdom of Anuchard.\n\nExplore handcrafted, unique dungeons. Each was changed by magic to match the personality and aspect of its owner.\n\nEach is a unique challenge as a result. Master their unique mechanics to reach the slumbering Guardians - and unlock the deepest reaches of the greater Dungeon.\n\nRemember your duty: Confront and defeat the Guardians in set piece boss battles, to make them return to serve the people of Anuchard.\n\nRestoring Paradise\n\nAssist the Orchard along the path of a Bellwielder\u2019s legendary quest.\n\nRescue the souls of lost villagers trapped in the Dungeon, returning them to Orchard through the ritual of revival.\n\nEach revived villager contributes to your quest. Farmers, chefs, herbalists, all will help you and the rest of the village to restore Anuchard.\n\nPrepare for ever deeper ventures into the Dungeon. Cook up meals using ingredients provided by village residents, then head back into the fray!",

        "description": "Last Stop is a single-player third-person adventure set in present day London.  \n\nWritten and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters. \n\n- Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. \n\n- John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. \n\n- Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. \n\nLast Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising stars Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith and Kassian Akhtar as Dylan Hughes. \n\nLast Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. \n\nRoleplay as 3 unique characters. Make choices to shape their conversations. Walk in their shoes and discover where their individual stories lead. ",

Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil in this free-form shooting game with the spirit of 80s shooting classics Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta.\n\nPlatinumGames\u2019 NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the \u201cfree-form docking\u201d system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer.\n\nStory\nHumanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship.\n\n- Free-Form Docking\nThe Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You\u2019ll scramble with only one ship at first but pick up the right item and friendly ships will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. \n\n- Classic 80s-Style Excitement\nSOL CRESTA\u2019s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There\u2019s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. \n\n- PlatinumGames\u2019 New Challenge\nWhat would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting? This is the answer. The visuals are classic, but the originality and depth of the systems and gameplay provide a fresh and deep shooting experience that grows each time you play.",

        "description": "Devastator is a retro-inspired arcade twin-stick shooter designed for modern systems. Everything from the visuals, audio, and gameplay was designed, tweaked and polished to create the most intense and satisfying twin-stick shooter experience possible.\n\nSYSTEM initializing...\nMultiple virus infections detected...\nLaunching DEVASTATOR program...\n\nYou are the Devastator! Your objective is to eradicate 15 types of viruses in 3 unique modes: Quadrants, Sectors, and Cycles. In Quadrants, the wave layout is constantly changing as you battle increasingly intense waves of random viruses for 5 minutes. In Sectors, there are 55 unique waves of viruses across 5 sectors. And, in Cycles, you'll battle semi-randomized spawning viruses across 5 variations of 11 waves. Complete your objective as the Devastator and take back control of the System!\n\nIn addition to the main game modes, wave layouts, and various enemy virus types, Devastator's moment-to-moment gameplay contains surprising depth and subtlety, resulting in a vast gameplay variety. From the way you balance speed vs. firepower, to the utilization of resources, to knowing when to pick up powerups, Devastator rewards both fast reflexes and good strategy.\n\nTurbo-firing at the start (move fast without firing to build), and a charged blast at the end.\n\nDevastator also features vector-inspired visuals mixed with HDR colors, five customizable full-screen filters and mesmerizing particle effects, all while running at insanely high framerates on high-resolution monitors. With modern graphics hardware, the game runs with ease on current high-end gaming monitors (such as 360hz at 1080p, 240hz at 1440p, or 120hz at 4k), with the possibility to run at even higher resolutions in the future.\n\nDevastator was designed and developed by Luke Schneider (aka the Radiangames guy). Luke has been a huge twin-stick shooter fan since the 1980s, and has been developing twin-stick shooters since 2005. With Devastator, Luke decided it was time to make his ultimate and final 2D arcade-style twin-stick shooter.\n",

        "description": "You\u2019re not special. You\u2019re not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet.\n\nThere is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.\n\nABOUT BACKBONE\n\nBackbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation.\n\nBackbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nBackbone\u2019s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.\n\nAs Howard, you will:\n\u2022 Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth\n\u2022 Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be\n\u2022 Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver\n\u2022 Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss\n\u2022 Be a raccoon\n\nFEATURES\n\nPost-noir dystopia\nBackbone\u2019s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It\u2019s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.\n\nStunning visuals\nThe breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.\n\nEvocative and unforgettable soundtrack\nOriginal doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone\u2019s OST is expertly crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape that serves and enhances storytelling. ",

        "intro": "A bundle of 4 classics that will surely Tic your boxes and sweep you off your feet! ",
        "description": "Do you ever long for the olden days? Those lazy, rainy afternoons when you could just relax on your couch with a cup of tea and play games with your remote on one of those game channels. Or perhaps those slow days at the office where you knew there\u2019s nothing to do, so you just loaded up The Mines and zoned out for an hour. Wasn\u2019t life much simpler back then?\n\nWell if you\u2019re looking for that touch of nostalgia, you can\u2019t miss this bundle. Featuring Beat the Four, The Mines, Reversi Rulez and Tic'o'Toe , Classic Logical Bundle is sure to bring you back to the yesteryear of gaming. So put your feet up and get ready to experience the classics of gaming, alone or with a friend!\n\n\u2022 TIC'O'TOE\nA classic pen and paper game is here to keep you on your toes! Pick X or O and then take turns marking your symbol on a grid. The first one to fill in a row of 3 vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins! Play Tic'o'Toe against the built-in computer player or against a friend, locally - taking turns on your device. Will your strategy prove superior?\n\n\u2022 BEAT THE FOUR\nAnother classic brought to you digitally! Drop your piece in one of the rows of the vertically suspended board and watch it drop to the bottom. The first player to put 4 pieces in a row, wins! Play against the computer or with a friend, locally. Outsmart your opponent!\n\n\u2022 THE MINES\nA thrilling logical game now on Nintendo Switch\u2122! This classic needs no introduction. Press a square on a grid to reveal it, or use the flag tool to mark a mine. Each number you reveal represents how many mines are connected to the corresponding square. You win by marking all the mines. Be careful though, clicking on a mine will end your run instantly. Do you have what it takes to be a minesweeper?\n\n\u2022 REVERSI RULEZ\nA simple yet challenging classic. This 2-player game will make you unlock 100% of your brain. There is a 64 square grid, you start in the middle with 2 white and 2 black pieces, or 2 for each player. You have to drop a piece adjacent to the rest of the pieces, and when you do so, all the pieces between this new piece and your other pieces get flipped over to your color. Be careful though, your opponent can do the same, so plan ahead! The player who fills the board with more of his pieces wins. Play against the computer opponent or against a friend, locally. Master the strategy, outplay your opponent, and flip to win! Just\u2026 don\u2019t flip the table, please.",

        "description": "This is not Moorhuhn's first appearance in a new game genre on the Nintendo Switch\u2122. We hunted it mercilessly in Moorhuhn Remake, defended the Wild Wild West with it in Moorhuhn Wanted and competed in heated races in Moorhuhn Kart. Guide the Moorhuhn through the jungle in his first jump and run platformer for Nintendo Switch\u2122!\n\nThe Quest for the WHATSIT\nAn amulet lost 1000 years ago, the WHATSIT, has always been the Holy Grail of treasure hunters. Well, actually the Holy Grail is the treasure hunters' Holy Grail, but the WHATSIT comes right after it. And even Moorhuhn, the greatest adventurer among treasure hunters, cannot resist a hint as to the whereabouts of this relic. And so, he unceremoniously drops himself above the dense jungle and plunges headlong into the adventure.\n\nIn the depths of the dense jungle, the Moorhuhn follows the legend of an ancient, lost temple complex. Legendary treasures are said to lie hidden there, but above all a priceless treasure: the sacred amulet of WHATSIT!\n\nHidden traps, bad-tempered gorillas, aggressive crocodiles, strange shamans, forest spirits, temple guards, bats, warriors of the dead and stranded aliens require all the courage and skill of a real treasure hunter.\n\nAs you would expect from a proper jump and run platformer, you need to use all your physical strength, courage, and skill. Jumping and swinging, kicking, boxing and sometimes even shooting, Moorhuhn races through the depths of the jungle to find the treasure of treasures: The Amulet of WHATSIT.\n\nBut before that, there are all kinds of hostile opponents to defeat, obstacles to overcome and traps to avoid.

A dreamlike journey into a surreal world of the artist\u2019s own creations where the atmospheric gameplay provides mysteries to discover, puzzles to solve and artistic landscapes to explore.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou find yourself on an evolving island.

This intriguing world within the canvas holds more mysteries than even the artist intended.\n\nSTORY\nPrague\nJuly 20th 1945\n\nThe city of Prague was under siege, ravaged by war.\nBuildings were falling, churches were burning, and everything was to be washed away forever.\nA painter lived there, isolated from the outside world. The worse the terrors of war became, the more the artist obsessively painted beautiful landscapes as a contrast to the evil he had witnessed. One night, a mysterious figure appeared in the house seemingly out of nowhere. The stranger walked slowly around the room, inspecting the paintings. He then sat down in front of the artist; to offer him a deal.\nThe chance to enter one of his own creations, far away and free of war. But he would have to find his way back out before midnight, or else his soul would become trapped in the canvas forever. Feeling alone, on the edge of madness, terrorized by the scent of death creeping in from the streets, the artist shook the mysterious man's hand, accepting the deal.\nA few moments later, the house was empty.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Unique artstyle and a surreal environment to explore\n- A collection of clever puzzles that will challenge your creativity\n- An ever-changing world that develops as you progress\n- Hidden secrets to find",

In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\n\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.\n\nThe stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.",

        "description": "This is a story about one of the adventures Sophie the Alchemist had after she left her hometown of Kirchen Bell. It is centered around Sophie's quest of searching for Plachta after they are separated in a dream world of Erde Wiege, and the new friends they meet there.\n\nMain features:\n- Evolved Seamless Turn-Based Battles\nThis game incorporates new multi-link turn battles that feature six party members divided in two teams and begin seamlessly when players encounter enemies while exploring. The combat experience is enriched by a multitude of special effects and actions, including special Dual Trigger skills that involve two of the team members attacking in unison.\n\n- Two Types of the Panel-Based Synthesis\nThis game features an accessible puzzle-like synthesis system where you place ingredients on a panel to create new items. Players can choose to use either the Standard Panel or the Restricted Panel, which will increase both the difficulty level and the rewards.\n\n- Manipulate the Weather to Open New Paths\nWhile each region of Erde Wiege has fixed weather, you will be able to change this with the help of special tools. Changing the weather will allow you to not only change the scenery when visiting the same area but also gain access to new, previously inaccessible places. Perhaps the weather will affect even the materials you can collect?\n\nNote: Costumes can be changed in the \"Changing Room\" at the desk in the atelier.\nPlease visit the official website for more information. \nPlease beware that the main game is currently also available for purchase as a part of the \"Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream Digital Deluxe Edition\" set and \"Atelier Sophie 2: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream Ultimate Edition\" set.",

Sail stormy waters, dive unknown depths, and explore forgotten ruins in a beautifully realised, flooded world. \n\nAN ALL-NEW COMPANION TITLE\nExpanding on the desolate setting seen in FAR: Lone Sails, Changing Tides swaps sun scorched, dusty planes for stormy skies and high seas. With new environments, puzzles and ship mechanics, the world of FAR: Changing Tides brings an exciting experience to fans of this beloved series and new players alike with a bigger, deeper challenge.\n\nA NEW HOME\nOvercome the elements as new protagonist, Toe, who awakens to find themselves alone, stranded in a flooded world. What once was home is transformed into an unfamiliar and sometimes hostile environment. You must navigate Toe on an adventure to traverse the ruins of a once great society in search of a new beginning. \n\nCAPTAIN YOUR SHIP\nExperience the thrill of captaining a distinctive seafaring vessel. Together you\u2019ll brave high seas, navigate intense storms, and plumb the perils of a briny deep. Along the way, you\u2019ll need to keep things functioning by unlocking parts, fixing faults and searching the watery depths for precious fuel and salvage. The farther you travel, the more you\u2019ll learn about your ship\u2019s fascinating complexities.\n\nA MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE\nFAR: Changing Tides\u2019 moments of peril and intrigue are delivered by environmental dangers and puzzles to overcome, but these feed into the solitary, almost meditative approach to gameplay. Captaining your extraordinary ship, raise the mast, hoist and angle the sails, light the furnace and more as you learn to sail the ocean while mourning the loss of your home.\n\nSOUNDS OF THE OCEAN\nA dynamic soundtrack reacts to player and environmental actions, amplifying key moments in the game and heightening the atmosphere, meaning pulse pounding crescendos, serene moments of reflection and everything in between are created by, rather than scripted for, the player.",

Yet even these bad dudes are no match for the Demon King himself! Instead, the task falls to Beebz, a young demon barely a thousand years old, who decides it\u2019s time for her to kick every turf leader\u2019s butt and become the Demon Queen herself.\n\n\u2022\tA unique aesthetic combining the expressiveness of 2D illustrations with the depth and sense of exploration 3D environments can offer!\n\u2022\tA world chock-full of humor and style, from the music accompanied by the protagonist\u2019s rapping to the colorful characters inhabiting the world!\n\u2022\tA unique take on progression! Take a victory lap and explore previously beaten levels to discover their liberated state, with plenty of mechanical and environmental changes to uncover. Or take some time off in the hub town taking on sidequests and other distinct challenges instead.\n\u2022\tPull off some clever platforming combinations or get physical with a special physics-driven combat system that ramps up the chaos and fun. Push, pull and spin your enemies out of your way.\n\u2022\tA different take on checkpoints, freeing the player to place them wherever they want. Show off without them for a perfect run, or place one in preparation for a challenging section.\n\u2022\tUnique challenges like the \u201cPhoto Hunt\u201d mode where you\u2019re tasked to take pictures of hidden locations & surprising moments! Or simply take pictures and selfies for fun and share them across all social media!\n\u2022\tAn awesome collection of purchasable mods that can be combined in clever ways to completely change your playstyle! Or you could buy some dyes & pets instead, the world's your oyster!\n\u2022\tTons of carefully crafted levels that constantly introduce new challenges as well as engaging bosses full of character and life! Until Beebz gets to them...\n\nFrom the makers of Slime-san comes their newest creation! The team used everything they learned from their 2D platformer to elevate this 3D platformer to the next level!",

Join parkour master Marie Taylor and treasure hunter James Andrew in a historical action thriller, as they unveil the secrets of a forgotten kingdom which has been tragically trapped in and endless time loop. Explore a beautifully hand-drawn non-lineal open world, recover valuable relics, chart a lost island, and gather new clues in every loop to complete an ancient prophecy. Solve the riddles and mysteries that angered the old Gods, on your quest to prevent history from repeating itself forever.\n\nSecrets of the Minoan Cataclysm. In 1639 BC a powerful explosion devastated the Minoan civilization and sunk the birthplace of their empire: the volcanic island of Thera. History seems to repeat itself, as the island has resurfaced, and a new cataclysm is bound to happen. Why were the Minoan so advanced to their time? Did King Minos foresee their demise? Can a new eruption of Thera be stopped? There's only one way to find out!\n\nA sunken island trapped in time. Hidden in the depths for several millennia, the island of Thera is full of historical treasures to collect and mysteries to decipher. Discover a lost Minoan citadel, open your way through an ottoman sunken fleet and unlock the doors to underground palace, as you uncover the details about the folk who lived there and their tragic fate. Exploit a glitch in time to secure information on a persistent map and solve key puzzles before the world blows up and the loop restarts!\n\nTiming, precision and puzzle-solving. Buckle up for an action-packed adventure, as you parkour your way through a rough terrain full of challenges: surf steep slopes, climb high walls, vault over obstacles, swing on vines and jump over deep pits to explore a hand drawn open world. Every corner of the island hides an artifact, a clue or a piece of the puzzle that needs to be solved to save the world from disaster.\n \nYou are not alone on the island... Marie Taylor is the hero of the story, a brilliant treasure hunter who works with her associate, historian James Andrew, seeking out ancient relics. But this time they'll find out they're not the only ones aware of the Minoan scoop, as longtime rivals appear on scene to bring back ghosts from the past and complicate matters further. ",

Build your party and venture forth to discover the secrets behind ancient long abandoned cities and decide where your own morality ultimately lies in this turn-based action strategy game.\n\nCHARACTERS\nPlay as a varied and exciting cast of characters on your adventure through Estera, each with their own abilities and view on each other. As war continues to split the land, will camaraderie conquer all or will personal views rip your team apart?\n\nCOMBAT\nCreate your party from five different classes and dozens of playable characters. Combine hundreds of unique skills to ensure victory and never have the same fight twice as each character features its own upgrade and levelling tree.\n\nSTRATEGY\nCombine abilities to create powerful combos against your foes, or combine defensive abilities to negate the deadliest attacks. Combine burn, freeze, stun, cripple and more to obtain your goals, and use magic and tactics to protect your heroes.\n\nNARRATIVE\nDecide your fate with a deep branching narrative and choice driven decisions. Your actions may lead to an outcome which the world of Estera may not deserve. Should your party feature characters from all sides of the war, opinions may clash - with disastrous consequences.\n\nWORLD\nExplore the stunning world of Estera and breathe in the beautiful hand illustrated locations. Venture deep into murky dangerous woods, roam vibrant busy towns and ransack long forgotten tombs. From the dizzying heights of Tower Of The Ancients to the harsh lands of Arralash, the world is yours to discover.",

But you won't allow it.\n\nFight of waves of enemies, each consisting of at least 50 turns. Each turn you can collect connected tiles which will yield rewards depending on their type:\n\nPotions heal you and might even yield you a powerful healing potion that you might use whenever you need it.\n\nShields will replenish your armor and count towards your loot value.

You might even find explosives.\n\nCoins will allow you to purchase stronger weapons and more powerful armor.\n\nSwords can be connected with enemies to deal them damage. Killing them will increase your experience which will lead to levelups and new and better skills.\n\nAt the end of each wave you will encounter a boss enemy who is stronger and more dangerous than any other enemy you encountered on your way so far. Defeating him can unlock new features and new enemy types. Completing a wave may even trigger a random event that will offer you multiple choices to resolve it.\n\nAfter your first patrol you may also select one of multiple offered quests which will yield you tentacles and other rewards which can be used to purchase permanent upgrades for your cave.\n\nWill you be the saviour of your people? Or just another worm, crushed under the heels of those so-called heroes?",

In Airport Simulator: Day & Night, your challenge is to keep the wheel turning and ensure that everything in the airport runs smoothly around the clock.\n\nFirstly, you will need to take care of fleet and baggage management to handle transporting passengers and the ever-increasing number of aircraft from various airlines. In addition, security checks, airport hygiene and maintenance are also crucial and need to be well managed.\n\nDepending on the time of day and weather conditions, your tasks will vary. For example, in frosty weather, the de-icing of wings becomes the main focus of attention. \nThese are just some of the important parts of running your organization as you compete against other international airport competitors.\n\nGoal-oriented management, satisfied staff, and happy passengers - will you achieve your goals through hard work and commitment? In the beginning, you will take over many tasks yourself. Over time, you will be able to delegate tasks to your airport staff. For now, it is time to roll up your sleeves; in Airport Simulator: Day & Night, there is always something to do!\n\nDay & Night: Manage your airport at any time of the day and make sure everything runs smoothly.\nChanging weather: Safety comes first, and processes need to be followed in any weather condition. E.g. Taking care of de-icing wings.\nManaging the plane: Different types of aircraft all require inspection and cleaning of the interior.\nBusy traffic: Numerous detailed vehicles and aircraft on the huge grounds guarantees a realistic airport experience. Different vehicles can be steered by yourself.\nIntelligent AI and personnel system: Pilots, stewardesses, mechanics, taxiway staff all support you in your tasks. A good organization and overview are the key to success.\nVaried missions: Tasks such as de-icing, loading and unloading the aircraft, refuelling, transport and cleaning are just some of your extensive activities.\nRealism: Every action requires a reaction. Damage to vehicles or sick employees - everything is simulated.",

        "description": "Welcome to Clouzy!, the world\u2019s first daycare dedicated to clouds! Now, we know you may be used to clouds majestically sailing through the sky without a care in the world, but in this magical world, things are a little different, and these little clouds need a lot of love, care, and attention!\n\nYou\u2019ll have to learn the little clouds\u2019 tastes and preferences to cook the right meals for them, figure out their preferences for playing, and of course, make sure storms don\u2019t brew on the horizon; some of them don\u2019t play well with each other\u2026\n\nOf course, if you feel a bit overwhelmed, you can always step out for a brisk walk through the world.\n\nIn fact, you should go for it regardless! Some clouds have rather particular tastes and the ingredients needed to prepare them can only be found in the wild. Don\u2019t worry about venturing alone, you\u2019ll have a cozy friend to keep you company as you adventure across the world of Clouzy!\n\nVAST MAGICAL WORLD TO EXPLORE\nThe daycare is not the whole world, but rather, the heart of one. \nExplore, solve puzzles, and restore towering structures to life!\nAn expansive open world to explore, discover, and harvest! If you want to be the best crowd wrangler there is, you\u2019ll have to get out there and collect ingredients!\n\nVarious biomes to visit, each with their own atmosphere and tasks!\n\nCheck every nook and cranny to find hidden surprises and make discoveries!\n\nDAYCARE LIKE NO OTHER\nEver wondered what an aspiring altocumulus would eat? Wonder no more! \n\nEach day in the Clouzy! daycare, look after the little bundles of vapor! Learn their preferences and what makes them smile!\n\nClouds need more than just water and sunlight. They need food to thrive, and not just gruel either. You\u2019ll have to find all the fruits and other ingredients needed to make a tiny wisp grow into a proper cloud!\n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel a little overwhelmed when looking after future cirruses, but fret not. Your little companion, whether flying canine, feline, or ailurid pet will help you in your work as a cloud whisperer!\n\nSKY\u2019S THE LIMIT\nAnd certainly for the clouds under your care! As you run the daycare, you\u2019ll have to market a fairly robust skill set - more than one would expect from a job that focuses on looking after clouds.\nYou\u2019ll become a master cook. The cooking mechanic and plenty of tasty recipes allow you to whip up tasty meals for your wispy charges - all made using locally sourced ingredients!\n\nEvery step of the journey is logged in a journal that\u2019s as magical as the world of Clouzy. It\u2019ll track everything you discover, every adventure you go on, and everything else that might come in handy.\n\nOf course, you\u2019ll also be able to play with your companion and clouds. A proper work/life balance is essential to allow them to reach for the sky!",

        "description": "Will You Snail is a fast-paced action platformer with an AI twist that offers a unique single-player experience: a challenging adventure in a neon-glowing setting that blends combat, puzzle-solving, and lots of humor together.\n\nFEATURES:\n\nDODGE AI SPAWNED TRAPS! The evil AI Squid tries to predict your movement a few seconds ahead of time and uses that information in an attempt to stop you from reaching the end of the level. Will you win that intellectual battle or will Squid find yet another reason to make fun of you?\n\nOUTPLAY THE AI! A lot of levels in Will You Snail are relatively empty by default. The challenge comes from the interactions with the evil AI. You can change the difficulty at any time or let the game decide which one is the best one for you.\n\nSOLVE OPTIONAL PUZZLES! Solve some easy puzzles to calm down from the action. Across your journey you\u2019ll find a few more difficult ones as well, but every single puzzle in Will You Snail is completely optional and can be skipped if you want to.\n\nUNCOVER THE TRUTH! Find secrets, collect clues and try to piece together where you are and what happened. Will You Snail tells a rather crazy story about artificial intelligence, simulation theory and the future of humanity - and it\u2019s up to you to discover it.\n\nExplore, jump, die, repeat - and master all of the action-packed levels in this challenging platformer. Puzzles, secret hunting, a non-linear story about mysteries of the Universe, silly voice-acting and beautifully designed levels - all of this packed into this short but condensed, fourth wall breaking game! Quite a challenge, isn\u2019t it? The question is\u2026\n\nWill you snail?\n\nLANGUAGE NOTICE: Thanks to our amazing community, the game is avaible in a multitude of languages! Including: Magyar, Finnish, Serbian, Polish, Catalan, Estonian, Turkish, Bulgarian, Norwegian.",

        "description": "Set in an era when electricity wasn\u2019t a thing and nothing but imaginations of great inventors that set the world in motion, LIT test your own inner engineer and lets you discover the joy of experimenting with light at first hand.\n- The behaviour of light in LIT is physically accurate. That said, the amazing light paths you are going to build in LIT are possible but extremely hard to reproduce in real life. Our game gives you the opportunity to set up mirrors and glass pieces to reflect and refract a light beam as you wish.\n- Our puzzles are open-ended. We give you the rules and the tools, you show us how to solve the problem. We assigned a number of possible solutions to each level but don\u2019t let those numbers fool you - we\u2019re only waiting for the players to find solutions we haven't thought of.\n- Visuals threading on the thin line between cartoony and realistic. Good pacing. Relaxing music, which lets you zone in. All of that creates a unique, mysterious but warm atmosphere.\n- When light hits a mirror and it reflects, it hits glass and it bends. That\u2019s all. And yet, it offers thousands of possibilities, which means each of our levels is different and unique.\n- LIT is extremely intuitive. Testing the game on multiple gaming events proved that it works for all age groups and all types of players. You want to find every solution and beyond? Searching for a game for your 5-year-old? Or maybe you\u2019re trying to introduce your mum to gaming?",

The combination of dishes you choose to eat will impact your entire play style.\n\nBig Menu for a Big Stomach\nWith a stomach that can only take seven dishes, you must put together a meal that maximises your abilities. Guava juice, grilled shrimp, or crab stirfry may mean the difference between health recovery, damage output or a watery shield.\n\nTools of the Trade\nCraft all kinds of deadly weapons out of the animal and plant parts you can't eat. Pair them with your favorite dishes to create the most overpowered combat combo.\n\nFarm-fresh & Locally-sourced\nIn this day and age, ingredients are hard to come by. You should be prepared to face off electrical snails, razor-sharp shrimp claws, and laser wasps to get the delicious parts you need.\n\nSomething Doesn\u2019t Feel Right...\nFrom the self-professed-AAA-license-holding necro-chef, to the diabolical voodoo \u201cLord of the Forest\u201d, to the radical revolutionaries of the fruit revolution, everyone wants you to do their thing, but no one's really right in the head.

It is setup as a thrilling murder mystery and acts as a contrast to the somewhat calm and enjoyable gameplay. \n\nThe first levels are quite straight forward but the further you advance the more surreal and abstracted the levels become. \nOnce you have finished a chapter by collecting all memory pieces and finishing the overall story of a level you will continue into the next chapter.",

Once you have found all memory shards you are free to leave the world again and search for the next mind you want to explore. \n\nTherefore every single imagination world acts as its own small story with its very own theme, design elements, and obstacles.\n\nExperience the feeling of flying, immerse into beautiful and atmospheric landscapes and enjoy the unique storytelling of the game while getting to know a lot of interesting people on the way.",

        "description": "Kurokami-sama's Feast is a horror-adventure visual novel following an unlucky trio who find themselves hunting monsters to be turned into gourmet dishes for the powerful (and woefully famished) being known as Kurokami-sama. Using Kurokami-sama's ear to listen in on people's innermost thoughts, and wielding Kurokami-sama's arm to strike back at the supernatural, you will come face to face with the darkness that lurks beneath the veil of mundane society. Will our heroes find a way to escape Kurokami-sama's clutches before it's too late?\n\nDuring your encounters with monsters and otherworldly entities, you'll have access to a parameter called spiritual energy, which can be used to read minds and launch devastating attacks. Clever use of this resource is the key to overcoming the many trials and tribulations that await you in the world of Kurokami-sama's Feast.\n\nCruel and stunningly beautiful in equal measure, Kurokami-sama is the supernatural being who forces the protagonist into her service. Hoping to regain enough of her strength to break free from the magical barrier that binds her, Kurokami-sama commands you to procure cooking ingredients from the countless monsters that infest the city. Will you obey her, find a means to defeat her yourself... or perhaps make an attempt to seduce her? The choice is yours.\n\nFeaturing a wide and varied roster of supernatural entities, Kurokami-sama's Feast will pit you against monsters from comparatively recent urban legends, such as the Aka Manto and the Kunekune, as well as more ancient beasts of folklore like the Keukegen or the Sazae-oni. Beings of western and Chinese origin, such as the Boogeyman and the Onromaki, also make an appearance.",

Use powerful weapons and spells to break through hordes of enemies and explore laberynthine dungeons in this hectic roguelite FPS, while you improve your skills and discover new equipment. Will you be up to the task?\n\nEvil lurks in the depths\n\nAs a member of the most powerful magic order, your task is to protect humanity from the forces of evil. Face hordes of enemies and fearsome Guardians in epic and dynamic combats. Keep an eye on elemental resistances and vulnerabilities to maximize your efficiency, and earn experience to level up and learn useful perks that will help you reach the end of the dungeon in one piece.\n\nFirst Person Shooting at its finest!\n\nZiggurat 2 focuses on fast paced combat and constant movement, in which mistakes are paid dearly. You'll need dexterity, reflexes and resource management skills to have a chance of survival against the dangers hiding in the shadows, and manage to come back safe and sound.\n\nNo two plays are the same\n\nFollowing the line of its predecessor, in Ziggurat 2 dungeons are randomly generated, full of dangers and treasure for the bold wizards daring to enter them. Going a step further, dungeons now have more verticality and variety, and more compact rooms, for quicker fights and easier exploration.\n\nBack to the Citadel\n\nIn the Citadel, home of the Brotherhood, you'll be able to recruit new and old allies, as well as improve your equipment and skills, before deciding which mission to perform next. With dozens of unlockable weapons with different natures and behaviors, preparation before a mission is crucial and may be the difference between an overwhelming victory and the bitter taste of defeat.\n\nImproved formula\n\nZiggurat 2 has been redesigned from the ground up with the goal of improving over the original in all areas, and offer an even smoother and faster experience, with quicker, more intense sessions, and more interactive and fulfilling progression.",

Find a hat that truly speaks to you (and try not to lose it in the rush of battle). Pick a paint job that makes your heart sing.\n\nFOUR ARENAS\nRanging from a peaceful stony outcropping to a deadly lava lair, pick an arena that will challenge you and your friends.\n\nTEAM UP\nPlay against some rather friendly or vicious AI; great for blowing off steam or getting some practice in.",

As Jeremy dives into Leo's past in order to find him, he can't quite shake the feeling that there's a lot more going on than a simple vehicle-related accident. Jeremy's not gonna just sit around and wait. The night is still young and there's a mystery to be solved!\n\nThis game is styled after old pre-2000s adventure games. This means bottomless pockets for any items you deem useful, dialog options and a story to click (or touch / button press) and puzzle your way through. This time around you even have thoughts in your inventory, allowing you stay focused on the taks ahead. Don't question it. Just throw your thoughts and items at any people you meet. Unlike in real life, talking to other humans isn't hard in this game! So why go outside when you can play this instead?\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u25cfOver 30 scenes (or 'rooms' if you will) to explore\n\u25cfOver 12 other characters to interact with\n\u25cfMaybe your boyfriend will tag along a bit later\n\u25cfVarious visual options aka retro modes\n\u25cfA weird story with mystery/supernatural elements\n\u25cfTwo endings\n\u25cfNo dead ends\n\u25cfSome additional stuff to do if you want to be extra nice",

Cold, crisp mornings are the norm, and you have decided that you're no longer okay with letting the mob use your pigs to dispose of bodies. When your old friend - a hitman - arrives with his assistant to deliver another body, you finally screw up the courage to tell them that you're done.\n\nYour friend doesn't want you to stop. He knows that there's no such thing as quitting, so he'll try to convince you that you're making a mistake. You spend the day together, doing chores and exploring the nooks and crannies of an authentic environment in the American Midwest alongside the man who will be forced to kill you, if he can't convince you to stay.\n\nHow you respond will determine the rest of your life.\n\nAdios means goodbye.",

        "intro": "Explore Elk - An island with true stories",
        "description": "Welcome to Elk is a biographical adventure set on an island like no other, where every character you encounter has a story to tell. From the weird and wonderful to the dark and desperate, all the tales told on Elk are based on true stories of life on the road less traveled.\n\nTales of real stories\nWelcome to Elk, an adventure game set on a fictional island stitched together with true stories and tall tales, and inhabited by the people who lived them.\n\nStory\nYou play as Frigg, a young carpenter trading their busy life in the city for an apprenticeship in a small town. When she arrives in Elk, Frigg worries that the slower pace of life will be boring (they don\u2019t even have the internet), but quickly discovers nothing could be further from the truth!\n\nTragic stories told with love and sometimes humour\nThe stories reflect the drama of our lives, on Elk it\u2019s known that humour, love and death go hand in hand. Life may seem hard sometimes, but it is always followed by laughter.\n\nMake new friends\nOn Elk, you will meet weird and wonderful characters - people whom the world has either ignored or forgotten. Follow their ups and downs, their odd drinking rituals and their unique ways of tackling whatever life throws at them.\n\nUnique mini games \nHelp your new friends on Elk through playful mini games. All games are uniquely tailored to underline the story and the mood of the game.\n\nMeet the people who told the original stories\nWe value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and share them. That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who inspired us to make this game.\n\nHow we used true stories in the game?\nTrue stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have dealt with it in Welcome to Elk:\nThe stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative. Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of originally and only us who designed it will ever know \u2013 or come close to the real truth of the stories.\n\nWelcome to Elk might look like a \u201cfun\u201d game but it\u2019s about telling stories \u2013 some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand.",

        "description": "In a place beyond time and space, the Reapers formed an independent Union so they wouldn't have to answer to the Horsemen of the Apocalypse anymore.\nWith no acceptable candidate for the position of Union leader, the atmosphere at the Union has descended into blissful anarchy, which is not great for productivity.\nFortunately, a new Reaper gets hired as a Sorter one day - you.\n\nRules\nSend clients to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory based on the various signs they have. There are tricky clients who interact with each other, interfere with the Reaper's work, or ignore the basic rules, which means you'll have to be extra careful when you're deciding where to send almost everyone.\n\nClients\nMany clients are unique individuals. Some of them are even a little famous - but any resemblance to actual people is totally, entirely coincidental. They're not just unique faces, though - they also have unique abilities. For example, Jailers won't let you send prisoners anywhere, Bureaucrats will surprise you with inspections, and the Musketeers are one for all and all for one!\n\nThe Reapers Union\nThis is where the Reaper goes after every work day just to go to work again! But first you can accept contracts, view jobs from the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, get the latest news from this world, and do super important favors for other Union members. After all, every candidate needs faithful friends when there's an upcoming election.\n\nHorsemen of the Apocalypse\nNow that the Union is up and running, the Horsemen finally have time to devote to their beloved side projects. Death's Agency, War's Arena, Pestilence's Laboratory, and Famine's Diner are all open for business!\n\nAnything else?\nCatastrophes, a rental apartment, a bunch more events, laughs, and maybe even cats. You'll definitely get to do some fishing and listen to awesome music.\n\nGood luck, Mr. Master Reaper!",

        "description": "Ganryu 2 is the sequel to the Ganryu game made by VISCO on NEOGEO back in 1999. The universe takes place in a feudal fantasy Japan which is strongly inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi, whose adventures are unfolded in a series of books (mainly \"The Stone and the Sword\").\nPlay as Miyamoto Musashi and travel through a 17th century fantasy Japan, from north to south to the island of Ganryu-jima where everything started between Musashi and Kojiro.\n\nStory:\n\nAfter his victory against Kojiro, Musashi decided to meditate and try his hand at art, in the north of Japan, in the province of Hokkaido. During one of his meditations, a spirit contacted him : \"Miyamoto Musashi, our fight is not over, I am waiting for you to finish our fight once and for all! All of Japan will pay for your insult! I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!\u201d \nThere is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojir\u014d\u2019s one. His body was defeated, but his spirit remains, and his intentions are still destructive. Miyamoto Musashi then understood that he would have to travel across Japan from north to south and go to the island of Ganry\u00fb-jima, where he firstly defeated Sasaki Kojir\u014d, to fight again and liberate the spirit of Kojiro forever.\n\nFeatures:\n- A hack'n'slash inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi \u201cThe Stone And The Sword\u201d released in 1930\u2019s by Eiji Yoshikawa and which is one of the most famous story and real samurai in Japan!\n-\u00a0Explore a 17th century fantasist Japan through seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.\n-\u00a0\u00a0Defeat Kojiro in The Floating Fortress and save Japan! \n-\u00a0Dash, double-jump, wall-jump and throw kunais to defeat various enemies!\n- Use your special abilities, kamis, to take advantage of your enemies.\n- Collect Hanafuda cards through levels.\n- A beautiful pixel-art game inspired by classics such as Shinobi 3 and Shadow Dancer.\n",

However, since raw eggs are fragile, their durability decreases as they encounter walls and floors. The game is over when the durability disappears.\n\n* Feature\n- Online Multiplayer: Raw eggs have friends, and those friends (raw eggs) are also brave enough to go on adventures at their own pace. Every once in a while, you'll run into one of them. When you do, be sure to exchange greetings and enjoy each encounter and parting of the ways. Of course, silence is fine. Also, I can't say this out loud, but when your companion breaks up (not a breakup), he will drop a recovery item. A maximum of 10 people can play together.\n\n- Hang on function: This is definitely the highlight of the project. It allows the egg to regain its composure after rolling around restlessly for a while. Simply put, it's a brake function.\n\n- Beautiful stage: Let's have a pleasant adventure on a fantastic and graceful stage of the world.\n\n- Hidden items: Fried eggs will require a toast. The toast is hidden somewhere on the stage.\n\n- Growth system: The more you move, the more durable the raw eggshell will be. Even if goal is difficult, if you play without giving up, eggs will become more and more strong and it will be easier to clear. You will be fascinated by the dependable eggs.",

        "description": "Join Lottie\u2019s Paradise Planning team and travel to a distant group of beautiful resort islands with a diverse set of landscapes. This time, you are in charge of inviting characters as clients and helping them live out their own dream vacations. Choose from a variety of islands, with different terrain and climates and find one that matches your client\u2019s vision. Then start designing and start making their vacation dreams come true. Just wait until you see the look on your clients\u2019 faces after you reveal the vacation home decorated just for them.\n\nAdd personalized touches to your client\u2019s resort island\n\nCustomize everything from home exteriors and interiors, the yard and even customize the weather to either be sunny or rainy. Handpick the picture-book spot for your resort creation and use the Paradise Planning team\u2019s expansive inventory to deck out vacation homes without being limited to your own inventory, recipes, or resources. The editing tools make decorating a snap! It\u2019s a breeze to go back and redecorate as you like, so change and rearrange to your heart\u2019s content.  \n\nAs you design more vacation homes for your clients, facilities like a caf\u00e9 and a school around the Paradise Planning office will open up. Decorate these into inviting locales, choose roles for different characters, then watch your clients spend time together.

Challenging the Demi-fiend is best attempted in the post-game.",

She's a lover of many fandoms, always writing a fanfic or drawing fanart. \nShe's snarky, chaotic, and ultimately good-hearted. She's more than ready to explore her own truth and be unapologetically herself.\nWe love her partly because she's like us. We love her partly because she's what we'd like to be.\n\nThat's the charm of our beloved and adorkable eldritch cutie.\nIn a way, she IS us.\nSo maybe... today we can be her.",

You want to find an elusive rare bird in the forest and snap its picture. You have to kill a man in the back room of a shady diner.\n\nThis is Paratopic, an experimental first-person horror game named by Rock, Paper, Shotgun as one of the best games of 2018, and by FACT mag as having one of the top 10 soundtracks of the year.\n\n\u2022 A narrative-driven horror-tinged adventure game that takes you on a journey through a cruel fever dream world.\n\n\u2022 Cut between numerous detailed and varied vignettes to unravel how the stories of three separate characters intersect.\n\n\u2022 Explore the detritus of forbidden industry, kill, drive through the night, find yourself in conversation with some very off-kilter individuals.\n\n\u2022 A leisurely playthrough should take forty-five minutes, give or take, with plenty more to discover in the detailed, grimy low polygon environments. Or speedrun it, if you'd prefer.\n\n\u2022 Over an hour of gorgeous dark ambient music is used to create our subtly dynamic soundscape. An anachronistic blend of modern and outdated production as glitches and textural pads meet synthesis & sampling akin to 1990s Unreal Engine soundtracks.\n\n\u2022 Playable both in TV and handheld mode, experience a critically acclaimed short-form masterpiece at home or on the go. Take the horror with you.\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\u201cParatopic sticks with you. It's the kind of game that lingers, haunting the dark corners of your mind after its credits roll. There's something off about it in a delightful way; the atmospheric fever dream of low-poly horror imagery shows, but never tells.\u201d\nDestructoid\n\n\u201cParatopic\u2018s city is a sooty husk, a ruin whose scarce inhabitants eke out day-to-day existence by taking dangerous smuggling jobs, murdering for money, or reconfiguring their flesh in agonized cathode-ray rapture.\u201d\nHeterotopias\n\n\u201cParatopic is a short first-person horror game which draws ideas from Thirty Flights Of Loving but takes them somewhere terrible, leading them down an alley and through an unmarked door into a world which looks a bit like ours but just isn\u2019t right.\u201d\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nAWARDS\n\nExcellence in Audio Winner 2019\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nNuovo Award Nominee\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nExcellence in Visual Art Honorable Mention\nIndependent Games Festival\n\nThe Best PC Games of 2018 So Far\nRock, Paper, Shotgun\n\nFavourite Games of 2018\nAVClub\n\nThe 10 Best Video Game Soundtracks of 2018\nFACT mag\n\nBest Horror Games of 2018\nBloody Disgusting",

Build & manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

Play the genre-defining classics of the original Grand Theft Auto Trilogy: Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas updated for a new generation, now with across-the-board enhancements including brilliant new lighting and environmental upgrades, high-resolution textures, increased draw distances, Grand Theft Auto V-style controls and targeting, and much more, bringing these beloved worlds to life with all new levels of detail.\n \nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy \u2013 The Definitive Edition includes: \n \n\u2022\tGrand Theft Auto III: It all starts in Liberty City. With the revolutionary freedom to go anywhere and jack anyone, Grand Theft Auto III puts the center of the criminal underworld at your fingertips, if you have enough guts to take it.\n\n\u2022\tGrand Theft Auto: Vice City: Welcome to the 1980s. From the decade of big hair and pastel suits comes the story of one man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Grand Theft Auto returns with Tommy Vercetti\u2019s tale of betrayal and revenge in a neon-soaked tropical town full of excess and brimming with possibilities.\n\n\u2022\tGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas: Five years ago, Carl \u2018CJ\u2019 Johnson escaped the haze of Los Santos, San Andreas...a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs, and corruption. Now, it's the early 90s. CJ\u2019s got to go home - his mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart, and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of cops frame him for homicide, forcing CJ on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets in the next iteration of the series that changed everything. \n\nDeveloped by Rockstar Games, adapted by Grove Street Games.",

Pilot 3 fighters and take back the sun from the clutches of evil with this SOL CRESTA bundle that offers both the slick and speedy gameplay of the main game's Arcade Mode, and the densely woven story and unique case of Dramatic Mode!\n\nPlatinumGames\u2019 NEO-CLASSIC ARCADE series carries on the spirit and fun of classic gaming using modern technology, and the first project in this endeavor is SOL CRESTA. SOL CRESTA takes the docking and formation strategies of classic shooting games Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta and elevates them with the \u201cfree-form docking\u201d system. The flagship Yamato, composed of the fighters Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and Susano can utilize various attacks depending on how the three ships are aligned. Docking, splitting, and reforming the ships as needed is the key to defeating the invading armies of Mega Zofer.\n\nStory\nHumanity faced a crushing defeat at the hands of the Mandler Army during their last invasion of the solar system. Losing the moon and being driven from Earth, they were forced to retreat all the way to Laomedeia, the 12th moon of Neptune. With the last of their hope, they formed the solar recovery squad SOL CRESTA, and placed the fate of the solar system with the Yamato, a cutting-edge docking ship.\n\n\u30fbFree-Form Docking\nThe Yamato, standing against the evil of Mega Zofer, is composed of 3 fighters. You\u2019ll scramble with only one ship at first but pick up the right item and friendly ships will appear for a power-up! Dock and split to change your attack properties and use different formations to access an amazing arsenal. \n\n\u30fbClassic 80s-Style Excitement\nSOL CRESTA\u2019s music is provided by legendary chiptune composer Yuzo Koshiro, and the game pays homage to the sound and visuals of the earlier Cresta series games, bringing back that arcade fever while taking it beyond mere nostalgia. There\u2019s even a time limit, high score Caravan Mode, and online leaderboards. \n\n\u30fbPlatinumGames\u2019 New Challenge\nWhat would happen if PlatinumGames, developers of satisfying and jam-packed action games like Bayonetta, NieR:Automata, and ASTRAL CHAIN tried their hand at shooting? This is the answer. The visuals are classic, but the originality and depth of the systems and gameplay provide a fresh and deep shooting experience that grows each time you play.\n\n*The SOL CRESTA Dramatic Edition includes the main SOL CRESTA game and the Dramatic DLC.\nPlease see the SOL CRESTA Dramatic DLC store page for details about Dramatic Mode.\n",
