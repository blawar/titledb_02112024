In this action-puzzle game, paper pals Snip and Clip must cut each other up to overcome tricky obstacles\u2026or just to laugh their heads off (sometimes literally). Partner up with friends or family to cut the heroes into the right shapes, interact with objects, and solve a world of imaginative puzzles. \n\nSomeone grab a paper weight\u2014these puzzles just won\u2019t stay still! The only limitation to solve puzzles is your imagination. Snip may need to cut Clip into a needle to pop balloons, or maybe they\u2019ll have to team up to form a squawking, egg-laying bird! \n\nWhen playing together, prove you\u2019re a cut above the rest in Blitz mode, where 2-4 players* can compete in a series of puzzlingly action-packed challenges. Three is never a crowd when you\u2019re paper thin, so make it a party! In Party mode, up to four players* can team up to solve tough challenges. Ready or not, this couch co-op is a riot, any way you cut it!",

To win, flip the most panels to your color in local battles, online*, or single-player. The more you flip, the faster you\u2019ll move in a mad dash to nab power ups. Increase your flip range, turn invincible, and more across 3 modes and 12 arenas! Compete alone or against up to 3 players to see who\u2019s best at each mode: flip the most panels before time runs up in Panel Battle, knock out the most opponents in Time Battle, or outlast your rivals in Life Battle. All 12 arenas have 4 layouts to choose from, some containing hazards like panel-flipping buttons, beam cannons, and waves so beautiful they truly stun competitors. Learn the art of the flip with tutorials and try your hand at achievements. When you\u2019re ready to compete, jump into an online* battle or a private room with friends via local wireless. No matter how you play, it\u2019s time to think fast and pull off the ultimate color scheme!",

Sharpen your knives and dust off your chef\u2019s whites, there isn\u2019t mushroom for error and the steaks are high in these crazy kitchens!\n\nOn the Nintendo Switch\u2122, you can now experience the crazy couch co-operative action of Overcooked wherever you choose. Simply remove the Nintendo Switch console from the Nintendo Switch Dock\u2122 to take your culinary adventures on the road, just like our plucky chefs travelling around the Onion Kingdom!\n\nThe Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.\n\nOvercooked Special Edition features all the exhilarating (and enraging) kitchens from the main game, as well as both expansions, \u2018The Lost Morsel\u2019 and \u2018Festive Seasoning\u2019.\n\nA CULINARY QUEST\nThe Onion Kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual kitchens for you to conquer. Take part in an epic journey and tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens which will push your skills of co-operation and \nco-ordination to the very limits. Each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs.\n\nSIMPLE CONTROLS/DEEP CHALLENGE\nOvercooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a\nwell-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!\n\nWith Nintendo Switch HD Rumble, become immersed in the crazy culinary antics like never before.\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY\nWhether indulging in deep fried local co-op or saut\u00e9ed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.\n\nJust like cooking itself, Overcooked is best enjoyed with friends! Call in backup from a buddy by detaching the Joy-Con\u2122 controllers and get to work! Add in an extra set of Joy-Con controllers or two Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers\u2122 and you can play with up to four players for even more frantic fun.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!\n",

Select a hero [or team up in co-op] and battle your way to the bottom of the Gungeon by surviving a challenging and evolving series of floors filled with the dangerously adorable Gundead and fearsome Gungeon bosses armed to the teeth. Gather precious loot, discover hidden secrets, and chat with opportunistic merchants and shopkeepers to purchase powerful items to gain an edge.\n\nThe Gungeon: Enter the Gungeon \u2013 a constantly evolving bullet hell fortress that elegantly blends meticulously hand-designed rooms within a procedurally-generated labyrinth bent on destroying all that enter its walls. But beware \u2013 the Gungeon responds to even the most modest victory against its sentries and traps by raising the stakes and the challenges found within! \n\nThe Cult of the Gundead: The Gungeon isn\u2019t just traps and chasms \u2013 calm your nerves and steady your aim as you face down the gun-totting Cult of the Gundead. These disciples of the gun will stop at nothing to put down the heroes in their tracks and employ any tactics necessary to defend their temple.\n\nThe Gungeoneers: Choose between one of several unlikely heroes, each burdened by a deep regret and in search of a way to change their past, no matter the cost. Filled with equal parts courage and desperation, these adventurers won\u2019t hesitate to dive across flaming walls, roll through a wall of bullets, or take cover behind whatever is around to make it to their goal alive!\n\nThe Guns: Discover and unlock scores of uniquely fantastic guns to annihilate all that oppose you in the Gungeon \u2013 each carrying their own unique tactics and ammunition. Unleash everything from the tried and true medley of missiles, lasers, and cannonballs to the bizarrely effective volley of rainbows, fish, foam darts, and bees! Yep, bees. ",

If you run out of time or fail on any particular level, you are given three \u2018continues\u2019 - displayed as hearts at the top left of the screen.\n\nAn Auto-solve help system avoids you becoming trapped and frustrated.\n\nOnce you have \u2018unlocked\u2019 (completed) a level within Arcade mode, you are then allowed to access it within Time Trial or Practice modes.\n\nTIME TRIAL MODE: Finish the game as quickly as you can!\nYou can try any \u2018unlocked\u2019 level as many times as you like, recording your best times along with your name for that level.\n\nPRACTICE MODE: Play the game at your own speed, no ticking clock to worry about and each time you restart, you continue where you got to last time.\n\nTWO PLAYER MODE: Go head-to-head with a friend in the exciting 2 player mode, using one Switch console either side by side in TV mode or competing end to end using a Joy-Con each to see who can finish 10 levels the quickest?!\n",

By strategically choosing the right Pikmin for the job at hand and changing between the three captains (or coordinating with a second player), you can work efficiently to collect fruit and grow your Pikmin squad. \n\nWhen you aren\u2019t busy collecting fruit and saving your planet, try out Mission mode to accomplish set requirements like defeating enemies or collecting items. You can also compare your Mission mode scores with the rest of the world via online leaderboards*. Looking for some friendly competition? In Bingo Battle you must use Pikmin to retrieve items on your bingo card before your opponent does. \n\nWith more options for cooperative play, settings that make it easy for newcomers to start their Pikmin journey, new side stories and more, these tiny Pikmin are in for their biggest adventure yet.\n\nDownload the Nintendo eShop demo to sample Story mode, Mission mode, and even explore together with a second player! Your progress will even transfer to the full game, once purchased. As an added bonus, defeating the first boss in the demo and transferring save-data to the full version of the game will immediately unlock the \u201cUltra-Spicy\u201d difficulty option for the full game. \n",

        "description": "Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you\u2019ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air...",

        "intro": " Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 revives the good, old, action platform run & gun genre, but this time with a bunch of humor and buckets of blown off body parts. In this sequel to Guns, Gore & Cannoli, Vinnie Cannoli\u2019s story continues and this time it\u2019s personal. ",
        "description": "Welcome to the 1940\u2019s. Europe is being torn apart by the war, the USA is preparing for battle and the mob does business as usual. Only this time they went too far, even for Vinnie\u2019s standards.\n\nPrepare yourself to go to war after you make a shocking discovery about what actually happened during the end-stage of the Thugtown Massacre from Guns, Gore & Cannoli 1.\n\n\"Just when you thought you were out, we\u2019re pulling you back in!\"\n\nStory\n1944, the war in Europe is entering its final stage. 15 years have passed since Vinnie survived the Thugtown Massacre. But now, some loose ends start crawling out of the past, dragging Vinnie as far as the European battlefield of World War 2. Find out who is chasing Vinnie around like a dog, turning all his friends into foes.\n\nKey features:\n\nGuns, Gore & Cannoli 2 continues the rich, engaging gangster story of the first game and includes all the fast paced action you\u2019ve come to love, we made the best even better, with:\n\nUpgraded character mobility\nVinnie has received a massive upgrade in his mobility features. 360 aiming, double jumping, kicking, jump-kicking, dodge rolls, somersaults, dual guns and a weapon wheel.\n\nCampaign mode\nGuns, Gore & Cannoli 2 features a full single or multiplayer campaign mode, packed with action, humor and animated cutscenes.\n\nRich environments\nWe pushed our artists to the limits to produce the best immersive, atmospheric backgrounds, smoothest animations, and coolest special effects, setting a new benchmark for 2D games. Look for opportunities to bring down walls, explode barrels, drop crates on top of enemies, blow up cars and even kick your enemies through doors. Enjoy watching the corpses of your enemies fly through the air like ragdolls after you blast them away with your rocket launcher.\n\nImmersive world and period\nWalk around in the European battlefields of World War 2. Every level of Guns, Gore & Cannoli breathes the 1940\u2019s. Every inch of the game is like a picture straight from the second World War era. The cars, the furniture, the speakeasy clubs, the music, the propaganda posters, the streets and the weaponry reflect the turbulent time that the 1940\u2019s were.\n\nOnline and local Co-op mode\nYou don\u2019t want to die alone in the trenches? Well round up a platoon of 4 players and get blasting. Play as Vinnie in the solo campaign, or with up to 3 friends together while fighting through hordes of Nazis, zombies, monster, gangsters, cops, soldiers, tanks, submarines... in this all-new and incredibly fun arcade-style co-op action game. Teamwork is essential to surviving waves of enemy goons.\n\nHumor\n\u2018War is hell\u2019 unless you are Vinnie Cannoli and you turn every problem into a cynical joke, blurting out one-liners and snappy comments after a nice, juicy kill. Guns, Gore & Cannoli 2 will be a fun experience, not only to play but also to watch. Funny one-liners, screaming deaths, comical dialogs and hilarious enemies make you play this violent kill-simulator with a smirky grin on your face.",

Fight scary creatures, rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits, and weapons. Decide where to go next, whether it's upgrading this wrecked car, or rescuing that dog. Just remember, there are consequences for every action. Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Always keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet.\n- Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late.\n- Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new.\n- Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks.\n- A completely new end of the world from Finji (Canabalt, Night in the Woods).",

Can you beat the returning ten-time champion Handsome Hazuki and his cronies?\n\nChill out with some Party Games!\nSome people like bird watching. Some people like a lazy Sunday afternoon drive. Some people like to throw themselves into a trolley, and smash head-first into man-sized bowling pins! Set your shopping trolley's position, take a running jump, wince as you hurtle towards random hazards and pray you don't end up in the emergency room. Mastered the Turkey in bowling? Then take on the L.O.B.S.T.E.R gauntlet! A precariously narrow, randomly generated assault course. Swinging hammers, pneumatic boxing gloves, and irate American footballers conspire to knock you into the drink!",

        "description": "RAZED is a lightning-fast, single-player platform racing game that's all about speedrunning. \nSprint through dynamic neon levels in the quickest time possible, employing skills such as super-speed boosts, mega-jumps, drifts, stomps and strafes to bypass obstacles and uncover shortcuts to propel yourself up the online leaderboards. But there's a catch: powers cost momentum, and if your energy falls too low your shoes (and you) could very well explode...\n  \nNON-STOP ESCALATION\nSprint through 60 dynamic levels spread across six unique worlds, each with a distinct visual style, unlockable ability and pulse-pounding boss battle.\n  \nCHART YOUR OWN COURSE\nVeer off the beaten path and carve your own way through levels to achieve seemingly impossible times and unlock the S ranks.\n  \nONLINE LEADERBOARDS AND GHOST DATA \nChallenge the world via online leaderboards, and race against friends' ghosts in a game of asynchronous one-upmanship.\n  \nFUSS-FREE SPEEDRUNNING\nNobody wants to wait around while striving for perfection. Falling short of your target time? Simply jab the restart button to return to the start of the level without any loading times.\n  \nSECRET CHALLENGE LEVELS\nEmploy all your different abilities to find RAZED's toughest maps and tackle them head-on.",

        "intro": "Super Meat Boy is BACK!!\nPlay through literally thousands of levels!\nFight Bosses, find secrets, cry at an amazing story!",
        "description": "Super Meat Boy Forever takes place a few years after the events of Super Meat Boy. Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have been living a happy life free of Dr. Fetus for several years and they now have a wonderful little baby named Nugget. Nugget is joy personified and she is everything to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl. One day while our heroes were on a picnic, Dr. Fetus snuck up on them, beat Meat Boy and Bandage Girl unconscious with a shovel and kidnapped Nugget! When our heroes came to and found that Nugget was missing, they knew who to go after. They cracked their knuckles and decided to never stop until they got Nugget back and taught Dr. Fetus a very important lesson. A lesson that can only be taught with punches and kicks.\n\nThe challenge of Super Meat Boy returns in Super Meat Boy Forever. Levels are brutal, death is inevitable, and players will get that sweet feeling of accomplishment after beating a level. Players will run, jump, punch and kick their way through familiar settings and totally new worlds.\n\nWhat\u2019s better than playing through Super Meat Boy Forever once? The answer is simple: Playing through Super Meat Boy Forever several times and having new levels to play each time. Levels are randomly generated and each time the game is completed the option to replay the game appears and generates a whole new experience by presenting different levels with their own unique secret locations. We\u2019ve handcrafted literally thousands of levels for players to enjoy and conquer. You can replay Super Meat Boy Forever from start to finish several times before ever seeing a duplicate level. It is truly a remarkable feat of engineering and a monumental example of ignoring the limits of rational game design and production.\n\nThey don\u2019t give Oscars to games, but they probably will after Super Meat Boy Forever becomes the best movie of 2020 and 2021! Our story takes Meat Boy and Bandage Girl through several worlds in search of their darling little Nugget with beautifully animated cutscenes and musical accompaniment that makes Citizen Kane look like a reaction video to an sled unboxing. Players will laugh, they will cry, and when all is said and done maybe they\u2019ll emerge from the experience a little better than when they started. Ok so that last part probably won\u2019t happen but marketing text is hard to write.\n",

Fight your way to the final boss and escape or continue your run indefinitely to see just how long you can survive. A unique scaling system means both you and your foes limitlessly increase in power over the course of a game.\n\nDISCOVER POWERFUL NEW ITEMS\nMore than 110 items keep each run fresh and full of new challenge. The more items you collect, the more their effects combine, the more surprising some of those combinations might be. The more items you encounter, the more lore (and strategy) you\u2019ll discover through the logs.\n\nUNLOCK NEW WAYS TO PLAY \nUnlock a crew of ten playable survivors, each with their own unique combat style and alternate skills to master. Learn the secrets of the Artifacts to toggle gameplay modifiers like friendly fire, random survivor spawns, item selection and more. With randomized stages, enemies, and items, no run will ever be the same.\n\nPLAY SOLO OR CO-OP\nTackle the adventure solo or with up to three friends in online co-op, or compete in the rotating challenge of the Prismatic Trials. Brand new survivors like the Captain and MUL-T join classic survivors such as the Engineer, Huntress, and--of course--the Commando.\n",

        "description": "The game consists of over 50 boards, and your goal is the same on each of them: to switch on the fan.\nBut to achieve that, you must do much more than just push the button!\n\nThere is a current generator on each of the boards, linked to the fan through a path. Problem is, the path is broken in several places!\nTo ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged.\n\nSeems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required!\n\nYou just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive.\n\nBear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nFeatures:\n\u2013 the game was developed specifically with Nintendo Switch in mind\n\u2013 it mixes puzzle and arcade game mechanics\n\u2013 the game requires strategic planning, precision, and quick reflexes\n\u2013 comfortable controls using the accelerometer\n\u2013 dynamic score\n\u2013 beautiful graphics, dynamic lights and special effects\n\u2013 over 50 levels\n",

With a ragtag band of adventurers, you\u2019ll engage in well-balanced, turn-based battles and embark on quests across the kingdom of Erdrea. Forge gear, develop party members\u2019 skills, and alter their outfits without changing gear in this edition of the game! This version also lets you ride and attack with monsters on the field to earn experience points, as well as change between HD or 16-bit visuals, symphonic or synth music, and English or Japanese audio. Complete the tale with new character-focused stories, and travel to past DRAGON QUEST worlds!\nAcross the land, you\u2019ll meet the mysterious Tockles\u2014creatures that allow you to visit 2D, 16-bit versions of areas from popular entries in the series like DRAGON QUEST IV and DRAGON QUEST VIII! It\u2019s fun to see these classic worlds reimagined in retro style, meshing perfectly with the main game\u2019s 2D mode. Like all past DRAGON QUEST games, this one\u2019s character designs are based on the signature style of famed artist Akira Toriyama. Paired with the voiced dialogue, the rich personalities of your most loyal companions and fiercest enemies are brought to life, so you can fully immerse yourself in this quest to discover the Luminary\u2019s true heritage and awaken your power. For a greater challenge, start the game with the Draconian Quest setting, and capture your favorite moments with Photo Mode!",

        "description": "Call of Cthulhu, the official videogame inspired by Chaosium's classic pen and paper RPG, brings you deep into a world of creeping madness and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe. \n\n1924. Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies, cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.\n \nYour mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures\u2026 and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.",

        "intro": "GHOSTS 'N GOBLINS IS BACK FROM THE GRAVE!",
        "description": "Watch as this nostalgic yet completely reimagined storybook world unravels before your very eyes.\n\nTaking cues from both Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts and giving birth to something entirely new, Resurrection is a title worthy of its name.\n\nDon't be fooled\u2014this picturesque storybook world, while gorgeous, is a love-letter to the original titles and maintains the same punishing gameplay that fans have come to expect. So go on and test your mettle, for the gauntlet has been thrown!\n\n\nStory\n\nA long time ago...\n\nIn a far off land our tale begins, its beauty matched by none.\nThe knight, Arthur, and the princess there, bathed in midday sun.\n...but suddenly something's amiss, the town is up in flames,\na cloud of darkness does emerge, the palace it does claim.\n\nThe shadow then extends its reach, to the Umbral Tree divine.\nIts color fades, its vigor drained by powers most malign.\nAnd with this chaos wrought, the Demon Lord plays his vile hand.\nWhile Arthur's back is turned, the princess he kidnaps as planned.\n\nIn haste does Arthur don his armor, to save his maiden fair.\nTo the Demon Realm he does depart, so demons best beware.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nJust like its predecessors, Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection makes use of simple controls that anyone can enjoy. Use them to your advantage as you fight your way through weird and spooky stages filled with unique enemies in this enchanting world brought to life with modern technology and game design philosophy!\n\nGhosts 'n Goblins is, well, hard. Its unyielding difficulty has been a defining characteristic of the series, and Resurrection pays respect to that legacy. You'll die, and you'll die again, but you'll dust yourself off and get better with every attempt as you learn more about your foes and further craft your strategy. You'll struggle, but you'll also bask in glory once you do eventually emerge victorious. That is Ghosts 'n Goblins.\n\nIn Resurrection, Arthur can obtain 8 types of weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. Fell your foes with old favorites such as the Lance and the Dagger, shoot shockwaves with the Hammer to launch enemies, or send a Spiked Ball crashing along the ground to bowl them over instead! Use these\u2014and more\u2014to your advantage as you form your plan to progress through the Demon Realm!\n\nIn addition to his large arsenal of weapons, Arthur can also learn a magnitude of magic and skills. Use Thunderstorm to unleash a hailstorm of bolts in four directions, or learn Kitted Out to increase Arthur's inventory space and carry more weapons. With tons more available, be sure to make room for magic and skills in your strategy!\n\nMake full use of Arthur's weapons, magic, and skills as you brave the ordeals of the Demon Realm to bring the princess home safely. Muster every ounce of grit you possess; you're going to need it!\n\nOn top of single player mode, which focuses on the fun of hunkering down and overcoming challenges alone, Arthur can be aided in his quest by support characters, the Three Wise Guys. This gameplay style makes for an intense two player co-op experience\u2014a first for the series.\n\nGhosts 'n Goblins Resurrection can also be played with a single Joy-Con\u2122 held horizontally, so fun couch co-op play is as easy as passing your other Joy-Con\u2122 to a friend!\n\nNote: Local co-op only. Online play is not supported.\n\nExperience the sweaty palms and white-knuckles that come with single player mode, or share the fun with your friends in a party game-like co-op experience!",

Things can be a bit confusing at times, so let me remind you what's going on... You are TY, the last of the Tasmanian Tigers. Raised by a family of Bilbies, you can only vaguely recall your real parents. You've always thought that all the other Tassie Tigers died a long time ago.\n\nBut then the Bunyip Elder found you, and told you that your family is alive, but trapped in the Dreaming. Now hold your horses... don't get upset... you see they're not stuck there forever, if you're up for a bit of an adventure!\n\nYou see, deep in the Outback, there's this kind of glowy portal thing that is a doorway to the Dreaming. And around that portal there are some carvings in the rock, where five ancient mystical Talismans used to lay. Now, all you have to do is find the five Talismans, put them in the carvings, and the portal to the Dreaming will open!\n\nNow, before you go off like a frog in a sock, there's just this one SMALL problem. You see there's this evil cassowary - Boss Cass - who's also after the Talismans. Yes. THAT Boss Cass. The one that trapped your family in the Dreaming in the first place, and told the school board to remove all the meat pies from the tuck shops. And if you didn't think that made him enough of a megalomaniac, he's ALSO trapped a whole bunch of your Bilby mates in cages all across the outback... something about overdue library books... Anyways, if you want to open the portal, you'll have to beat him and his henchmen to the Talismans!\n\nDon't worry though, you won't be alone! You'll have a bunch of friends to help you along the way, including me - your old mate, Maurie. Now let's get down to brass tacks, find those Talismans, and rescue your family!",

        "description": "Immerse yourself in a dramatic yet charming and witty world of evidence-gathering, deduction and courtroom battles with this double-pack of the adventures of rookie lawyer Ryunosuke.\n\nSet in late 19th century Japan and England, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists, and \u201cturnabouts\u201d you\u2019ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!\n\nIn the course of each case, you\u2019ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn\u2019t shout \u201cOBJECTION!\u201d when you know you\u2019ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution\u2019s claims and prove your client\u2019s innocence.\n\nThe game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!",

Their job sucks, and lately, they're barely ever home to play with you. You're gonna fix all that with the power of being a chill little skateboarding bird. You may be tiny, but the more you skate, the more following you get, the more the world of bird skating will open up. Birds will come check out your park, help you find more parks, and together you'll (somehow) fix Big Friend's life! Above all else, skate birds try their best!\n\n",

There are a number of rules that give depth to the strategy involved in achieving three stars on each level:\n- You have a limited number of doses\n- Intentionally ending your turn early and letting the bacteria grow lets you research stronger antibiotics\n- All bacteria lose one health per turn\n- Any bacteria without neighbors die the next turn\n- Every isolated bacteria gains you bonus points\n- Each extra dose at the end of the game earns you bonus points\n\nAesthetic\nThe game features a mix of cute and sleek design with a visually pleasing color palette and satisfying interactions in every corner. The music is soothing and relaxing to listen to while you battle the unending bacterial proliferation.\n\nContent\nThe game contains the following amount of content:\n- Comprehensive and interactive tutorial\n- 14 brain-teasing and challenging levels\n- A creative sandbox mode (unlocked at the end of the game)",

As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features:\n\u2022\tThe player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\n\u2022\tYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon. \n\n\u2022\tLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\n\u2022\tExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony\u2019s two planets didn\u2019t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon. \n",

        "intro": "A new paper-crafted Mario adventure unfolds on Nintendo Switch!",
        "description": "The kingdom has been ravaged by an origami menace! Join Mario and his new partner, Olivia, as they battle evil Folded Soldiers, repair the damaged landscape, and try to free Princess Peach\u2019s castle from the clutches of King Olly in this comedy-filled adventure, only on the Nintendo Switch\u2122 system.\n\nMaster strategic, ring-based battles\n\nLine up scattered enemies and plan your attack to maximize damage with the new, ring-based battle system that requires both puzzle-solving skills and a quick wit.\n\nMario and Luigi receive an invitation from Princess Peach to attend an origami festival and excitedly hurry to Toad Town\u2026but something\u2019s amiss. After investigating the eerily empty town, the duo finds a fearsome (and folded) Princess Peach\u2014she\u2019s been turned into origami by King Olly, ruler of the Origami Kingdom! With five giant streamers under his control, King Olly binds Princess Peach\u2019s Castle and transports it to a distant mountain as part of his plan to re-fold the world.\n\nOn his journey to liberate Peach\u2019s Castle and repair the ravaged paper landscape, Mario meets Olivia, King Olly\u2019s sister, and the two join forces to put a stop to Olly\u2019s origami onslaught. Even Bowser falls victim to Olly\u2019s plot when his minions are turned into origami Folded Soldiers and betray their Koopa king, forcing him to ally with Mario and Olivia!\n\nBattle the Folded Soldiers in ring-based battles that challenge you to strategically line up enemies to maximize damage! Out of battle, Mario can use the arm-extending 1,000-Fold Arms ability in specific spots to interact with the landscape to pull, peel, hit, and more! Join Mario, Olivia, and their companions on a journey of laughter and emotion, thrills, and a whole lot of folding.\n",

        "intro": "Descend into the depths of an alien underwater world filled with wonder and peril.",
        "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\n\nDive Into a Vast Underwater World\n\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\n\nScavenge, Craft, and Survive\n\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear, and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\n\nConstruct Underwater Habitats\n\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\n\nUnravel the Mystery\n\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\n\nDisrupt the Food Chain\n\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\n\nHandle the Pressure\n\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\n\nFear the Night\n\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\n\nDive Below the Ocean Floor\n\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.",

Another player can join in on the fun with another Joy-Con\u2122 controller as you strive for a high score.\n\nBy using a pair of Joy-Con controllers and imagining them as the handles of a jump rope, players can virtually jump rope every day. With hopping bunnies as the characters, simple menus and no long tutorials to jump through, it\u2019s quick and easy to learn the ropes. You can even skip in style with a number of outfits and backgrounds!\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t able to jump, or are worried about disturbing the downstairs neighbors, players can bend their knees or move their arms to play the game without creating any noise. \n\nJump Rope Challenge was created by a small group of Nintendo developers while working from home in Japan as a simple game to add some quick and fun movement into their daily lives.\n\nMake sure to stretch properly before play. Game play requires varying amounts of physical activity. \n\nConsult a doctor before playing if: \n\u30fbyou are or may be pregnant, \n\u30fbyou have heart, respiratory, back, joint or other orthopedic conditions, \n\u30fbyou have high blood pressure, \n\u30fbyou have difficulty with physical exercise or you have been instructed to restrict physical activity. \n \nIf you experience excessive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness, discomfort or pain while playing STOP USE IMMEDIATELY and consult a doctor. Keep your activity within reasonable limits and avoid excessive exertion. \n\n*Not compatible with Nintendo Switch Lite\n**Jump Rope Challenge was developed using Unity, a real-time development platform.",

        "description": "Below Zero is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean world. It is a new chapter in the Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds.\n\nReturn to planet 4546B\n\nSubmerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to investigate what happened to your sister...\n\nUncover the Truth\n\nAlterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and databanks scattered among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own.\n\nDiscover Uncharted Biomes\n\nSwim beneath the blue-lit, arching expanses of Twisty Bridges. Become mesmerized by the glittering, mammoth crystals of the Crystal Caverns. Clamber up snow covered peaks and venture into the icy caves of Glacial Basin. Maneuver between erupting Thermal Vents to discover ancient alien artifacts. Below Zero presents entirely new environments for you to survive, study, and explore.\n\nConstruct Habitats and Vehicles\n\nSurvive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast across the snowy tundra on a Snowfox hoverbike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Seatruck.\n\nResearch Alien Lifeforms\n\nSomething undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Holefish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan, and visit the adorable Pengwings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.\n\nSurvive the Chilly Temperatures\n\nJump in, the water\u2019s warm. The below zero temperatures of this arctic region pose a new threat. New weather conditions blanket above-ground habitats. Craft a toasty cold suit, sip on piping hot coffee, and warm up next to Thermal Lilies to stave off the chill. \n\nAn ocean of intrigue\n\nWhat really happened to your sister? Who were the aliens who came here before? Why were they on this planet? Can we find solace from grief in truth? Below Zero extends the story of the Subnautica universe, diving deep into the mystery introduced in the original game.",

Players who wander off on their own will have difficulty surviving the elements, can fall victim to hostile wildlife, or become easy targets for the traitors.\n\nCommunication\nThere are several ways to communicate with other players, including proximity-based voice chat, private voice chat radio channels, text chat, and emotes - communication is key if the survivors have any hope of completing their tasks and defending against the traitors.\n\nBetrayal & Deception\nThe traitors are outnumbered and weak when the game begins, they may infiltrate the survivors and earn their trust while they build up their strength. Survivors can never be 100% sure of who to trust. The traitors can take advantage of this by spreading lies, and pitting the survivors against each other.",

        "intro": "The fantasy wargaming classic is back! Lead powerful heroes and mighty armies into battle in this critically acclaimed turn-based strategy milestone. ",
        "description": "Fantasy General II: Invasion is the reimagination of the strategy game classic from the 90s! \nArmies once again draw battle-lines on the war-torn land of Keldonia, and a new generation of commanders will test their bravery and tactics against each other. Fantasy wargaming is back! \n\nTrue to the tradition of the original game, Fantasy General II is all about turn-based battles. Lead over 75 different unique unit types, including powerful heroes. \nTake into consideration terrain, weapons and armour, magical effects, morale, and the balance of forces, make a plan, execute it, and vanquish your enemy, forging your reputation as a savage war-leader. \n\nThe battles\n\nBattle after battle, you will need to make decisions and develop your army. The young clan members will need to be trained, and as they gain enough experience, even the greenest recruits can be turned into champions. But beware: costly victories can be worse than a defeat\u2026 when battle-hardened units perish, so does their progression and experience.\nEach unit comes with their specific abilities, arms and armour, and they can be equipped with magic artefacts you find during battle and upgraded with gold and resources that you need to plunder from your enemy.\n\nThe clans\n\nA confederation of autonomous hill-land tribes, who value their independence and will fight fiercely for it. \nField axemen, berserkers, spearmaidens, trolls and shamans, summon ancestor spirits and mighty elementals or train nimble stag riders and deadly werebears or recruit mercenaries from longbowmen to centaurs.\n\nThe Empire\n\nThe most powerful realm on the face of Aer.\nFace the mighty Legions of the Empire and their magical creations from dragon cannons to golems as well as the Undead hordes they bring to battle, or fight harpies, lizard people and great dragons on your way.\n\nThe World\n\nThe world of Aer is filled with beauty and wonders. From the cold, magic-rich highlands of Fareach, home to the player\u2019s Barbarian Clans, to the Borderlands with their fertile river valleys and deep woods where witches and monsters still roam free; from the Sunken Land, submerged through a great Cataclysm and filled with treacherous swamp and Lizardfolk, to the refined and temperate Empire to the South, home to wondrous cities and built upon undead labour. Your campaign will see you fight across very different battlefields, requiring variable tactics and army composition.",

The world has expanded in other ways, too, with branching paths and multi-layered levels adding a third dimension to the classic 2d platforming gameplay.",

Armed with her trusted Shield Blade, Mirenia is so close to undoing the mistakes of her past. Will she succeed or ultimately only make matters worse?\n\nThe Skylia Prophecy is a sidescrolling action RPG set in a medieval fantasy world. As Mirenia, you will journey throughout the lands and towns, explore ancient dungeons and battle hordes of the undead in this hard as hell adventure inspired by the 'kill the player' philosophy of the 'Souls' games. Along your way you will meet the people of these lands, who will ask you to help them, sell you powerful items and reveal secrets to aid you on your journey. By interacting with the townsfolk, you will ultimately receive rewards that make the game easier in the long run - thus, you set the difficulty for the final stretch yourself!\nWill you find redemption or ultimately end up among the dead?\n\nThe Skylia Prophecy will challenge you on every turn with its hard but fair difficulty, powerful bosses and exploration based riddles.\n",

You can also flank enemies on both sides, then strike from behind for a powerful follow-up attack. Elemental chain reactions are also an important part of combat. For example, use fire to melt icy terrain, then use lightning to electrocute it. Push the enemy into the electrified water to see sparks fly in stunning HD-2D visuals!",

Go uphill or downhill on glaciers in the mountains and dangerous slopes with obstacles like tree trunks and rocks. Discover extreme sensations on a half pipe or pyramid in a snow resort to achieve the best time. The more you play, the better you become in handling the bicycle at high speed, but accelerate with caution as you may have a steep fall or sharp rising around the next corner.

So don't wait any longer, perform different cycling stunts, tricks and indulge yourself in this cycling excitement to get an adrenaline rush through the huge, beautifull mountains and hills!",

How will you lead?\n\nYOU ARE THE PRESIDENT\nAs President Anton Rayne, lead Sordland during your first term. Navigate a political drama, driven by conversations with your cabinet members and other significant figures in a country with its own complicated history. With looming border conflicts, entrenched corruption, economic crisis and people desperate for reform, as leader the difficult choices fall on your shoulders as you strive to uphold your election promises.\n\nA COUNTRY IN TURMOIL\nIn 1954, the country of Sordland is emerging from a 20-year dictatorship, following a bloody civil war. You play as a charismatic young man, Anton Rayne, who has surprised everyone by rising to the top of the party in power and getting elected as the new President of Sordland.\n\nThe people are hungry for democratic reforms after decades under a traditionalist power. The economy is in shambles and the political landscape is shifting. Neighboring superpowers are watching closely, and there are military threats on the horizon.\n\nAs President, you have the final say but every choice you make has an impact. Your colleagues, the opposition, corporations; everyone has a point of view. Think and act carefully: once enacted your choices can not be reversed.\nGood luck, Mr. President.\n\nWHO WILL YOU TRUST?\nWork closely with the Cabinet and prominent figures to forge strong policies and practices. You will need to keep your allies on your side and carefully consider where you will compromise your values and who you will make an enemy of. Everyone has their own ambitions in play.\n\nWHAT WILL YOU SACRIFICE?\nLeading a country is demanding. Face constant conflict about which is more important, serving the country or supporting your family. Is it possible to be a good father and a good president at the same time?\n\nHOW WILL YOU LEAD?\n\u25cf Weighty, dramatic conversations: Navigate intricate conversations in this 400K-word branching political drama.\n\n\u25cf Every choice has consequences: Make difficult choices on security, economy, diplomacy and more. Even outside the office, your values and beliefs will be challenged.\n\n\u25cf Make allies and enemies: Interact with a wide array of characters with different personalities and ideologies.\n\n\u25cf The oath of office versus family and values: See the real impact of the choices made in office on your family and close relationships\n\n\u25cf Pay attention to current events: Follow the situation in Sordland through reports and news.\n\n\u25cf What will your legacy be?: You can take the country in many different directions, resulting in one of 9 different major endings.\n\n\u25cf Every decision you make is final: there is an autosave feature that does not allow loading earlier saves. Make choices carefully.",

        "intro": "Action meets RPG as the Pok\u00e9mon series reaches a new frontier",
        "description": "Get ready for a new kind of grand, Pok\u00e9mon adventure in Pok\u00e9mon\u2122 Legends: Arceus, a brand-new game from Game Freak that blends action and exploration with the RPG roots of the Pok\u00e9mon series. Embark on survey missions in the ancient Hisui region. Explore natural expanses to catch wild Pok\u00e9mon by learning their behavior, sneaking up, and throwing a well-aimed Pok\u00e9 Ball\u2122. You can also toss the Pok\u00e9 Ball containing your ally Pok\u00e9mon near a wild Pok\u00e9mon to seamlessly enter battle. \n\nTravel to the Hisui region\u2014the Sinnoh of old\u2014and build the region\u2019s first Pok\u00e9dex\n\nYour adventure takes place in the expansive natural majesty of the Hisui region, where you are tasked with studying Pok\u00e9mon to complete the region\u2019s first Pok\u00e9dex. Mount Coronet rises from the center, surrounded on all sides by areas with distinct environments. In this era\u2014long before the events of the Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Shining Pearl games\u2014you can find newly discovered Pok\u00e9mon like Wyrdeer, an evolution of Stantler, and new regional forms like Hisuian Growlithe! Along the way, uncover the mystery surrounding the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon known as Arceus.\n\nPreorder for a special in-game costume and download the digital version for Heavy Balls!\n\nThe Hisuian Growlithe Kimono Set will be gifted to early purchasers of the Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus game. You can receive it by choosing Get via internet in the Mystery Gifts* feature in your game, up until May 9th, 2022 at 4:59pm PT. Then, dress yourself up in this Hisuian Growlithe Kimono Set! Players who purchase and download the game before May 9th, 2022 at 4:59pm PT from Nintendo eShop will get an email with a code for 30 Heavy Balls which can be redeemed through the Mystery Gifts* feature until May 16th, 2022 at 4:59pm PT. Heavy Balls have a higher catch rate than regular Pok\u00e9 Balls, but you can\u2019t throw them quite as far.\n\nAs the protagonist of this game, you'll meet Professor Laventon, who studies the ecology of Pok\u00e9mon as a member of the Galaxy Expedition Team. Before long, you'll join the Galaxy Team yourself and get to work as a member of the Survey Corps. Your goal will be to meet every species of Pok\u00e9mon in the region!\n\nAfter receiving an assignment or a request and preparing for your next excursion, you'll set out from Jubilife Village to study one of the various areas of the Hisui region. There may be certain Pok\u00e9mon behaviors\u2014or even entire species\u2014that you witness only under the right conditions, such as during a particular time of day or in certain kinds of weather. Word has it that some Pok\u00e9mon even act in ways that are unique to their species! Keep an eye on your health while out adventuring\u2014take too much damage from wild Pok\u00e9mon attacks or falling from high places and you\u2019ll be unable to go on!\n\nBattles in the Hisui region also have some unique properties. For the first time in the series, your Pok\u00e9mon unleash moves with the speedy agile style or the powerful strong style. These styles might also affect how many turns Pok\u00e9mon can take in a row!\n\nJubilife Village is the main base of your adventures in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus. In Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Pok\u00e9mon Shining Pearl, this village has grown to be the bustling Jubilife City. There are also characters in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus who are ancestors of some familiar faces you may know.",

You don\u2019t have to unlock the truck, but you will need to repair it to make it run and continue to protect it.\n \nZOMBIE HORDES\nAs you gather resources and build your shelter, you\u2019ll deal with waves of zombies, each with their own unique quirk, that will soon tear down your shelter walls. Once the map is clear, it won't be long before they return.\n \nCATAPULTS AND TURRETS\nWhat\u2019s a home without a little security? In Dawn of Survivors 2, you can build your own catapults and turrets to take down the massive hordes of zombies! From classic catapults, to flame throwers, to AK-47 turrets, you\u2019ll be able to design your own defense system that will keep the hordes at bay.\n \nSAVING SURVIVORS\nYou\u2019re not alone in this cruel world. There are numerous survivors out there that need your help! It\u2019s your choice whether or not to: help, trade, or betray them.  Be careful. The apocalypse makes everyone desperate.  \n \nADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENT\nThe environment around you will react to your actions. Whether you\u2019re building a shelter or gathering resources, the environment will change based on what you do, which in turn will affect your safety. You must constantly be aware of your surroundings and your decisions, because every decision in the apocalypse matters.\n \nESCAPE!\nIt\u2019s no longer just about gathering resources. Your mission is to escape! After fighting off the waves of zombies and building a secure shelter, you\u2019ll soon be able to call in the evac and survive the apocalypse! But it won\u2019t be easy. When you call in the evac, you must be ready for what happens next! It's up to you and your teammates to be ready for any attack.\n \nMULTIPLAYER MODE IS ON THE WAY\nWe will release the feature of multi-player mode later for online experience with the survivors from all over the world.",

From a simple game of tag to a run-and-jump obstacle course, each lesson is broken down into multiple, manageable segments that let kids go at their own pace\u2014and have fun in the process.\n\nLearn the basics of visual game programming \n\nBy playing through interactive lessons, kids will learn the basics of visual game programming. Nodon, colorful creatures with distinct personalities, keep kids engaged through lessons with tips and motivating messages. With a simple press of a button, swap between the programming screen and the game screen\u2014watch how programming changes the game on the fly.\n\nTrack progress and build confidence\n\nAfter completing each lesson and building a game, kids will test their knowledge by completing Checkpoints\u2014small puzzles or tasks to solve with programming. Master these skills and head to Free Programming mode to let your imagination (and programming chops) run wild.\n\nThe Nodon you meet each have distinct personalities that complement their functions. Have fun connecting them together to see how they interact and bring your game to life. The in-game Nodopedia lets you quickly check what each Nodon does as you create. There\u2019s also a guide that recaps important skills! Easily swap between the Programming and Game screens to see the hard-working Nodon in action.\n\nTake advantage of the Nintendo Switch system\u2019s many features. Instead of the control stick, program motion controls to control your game. Want to create some competition? Add in a multiplayer function and pass a Joy-Con\u2122 controller to a friend. It\u2019s up to you (and your Nodon friends) to decide what type of game you want to make.\n\nLooking for inspiration? Exchange codes and download* games from friends. You can even go into Free Programming mode to look at those downloaded games\u2019 programming and put your own twist on it. Upload your own creations and share them with other Game Builder Garage players*. Learn programming, build games, and share with friends!",

        "description": "ABOUT THIS GAME\nShibukawa, capital of Japan, 2054. Water drips from the cracked ceiling onto the edge of your bed as the incessant rain masks the whine of a refrigerator and the neon hum of the city outside. You don\u2019t recognise the heavy breath in your ear nor the warmth of the body lying next to you...\n\nThe world\u2019s gone to hell, and it\u2019s taking you down with it.\n\nWelcome to Shibukawa\n\nYou are Anna Isobe, a cybernetically enhanced cop in a world that\u2019s left you behind. Once a shining hope for the future, cyborgs have become taboo, replaced by drones and automata that make even your heightened abilities obsolete. Stuck in a thankless job surrounded by indifferent eyes you still have a duty to protect and serve, and that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to do.\n\nThe Sundew is a dark adventure game set in the aftermath of a devastating future war, where the world as we know it was twisted by flames into a terrifying new dystopia. What begins as a normal day quickly becomes something else, and soon a lonely beat cop will hold the fate of the world in her hands.\n\nThe dark future, realised\n\nThe Sundew pays homage to classic adventure games of old while reflecting contemporary issues and gameplay. Beautifully drawn pixel-art and stunning sound design brings this dark future to life and grounds you in a vision of humanity\u2019s progress that is both alien and strangely familiar...\n\nBrave New World\n\nJapan lies in ruins, save for the bustling haven of Shibukawa. Guide Anna through this new megalopolis and beyond in her search for the mystery behind a growing conspiracy. Travel from the backstreets of the city to far-flung isles, and the most notorious prison this side of the Steppe.\n\nChoose your fate and that of the world\n\nAlongside classic point-and-click gameplay The Sundew will ask you to make decisions that will change the future of humanity. Playing off contemporary issues, the choices offered are never black and white. Where do you believe mankind\u2019s interests lie, and what means are acceptable to achieve them?\n\nFeatures\n\n- Guide Anna Isobe, a cyborg cop with a dark past, through the unravelling of a global conspiracy.\n- Experience a diverse cast of characters, each with their own secrets and history.\n- Explore Shibukawa and the remnants of the old world.\n- Make decisions that will change the fate of humanity, for better or worse.",

        "description": "Ekstase\nEkstase is a love letter to Berlin and its techno scene. Amazing techno beats and beautiful visuals set the stage for a game that honors the long forgotten falling block puzzle genre. Fresh but familiar gameplay ensures that Ekstase is easy to pick up and sink many hours into. With both classic and new game modes, there is something here for both the casual and the hardcore puzzle game player.\n\nGameplay description\nIn Ekstase, shapes of 3-5 blocks fall from the top, and as soon as they hit something, they fall apart. The scan line changes color every cycle and removes the squares you formed with blocks of the same color.\n\nGame modes\nReach a \"state-of-flow\" in Flow mode\nFlow mode is the frictionless \"jump in\" game mode in which the game adapts to how you play. Are you getting better? The game will ramp up its difficulty. Are you getting worse? The game becomes easier. In doing so, the game teases out a \"state-of-flow\" in the player, a state in which you are fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, involvement, and enjoyment.\n\nKeep a beat with Beat99\nBeat99 is the rhythm mode in Ekstase . The goal is to rank up your multiplier by dropping shapes to the beat. You'll be given 99 \"lives\", dropping a shape subtracts one life, missing a beat subtracts ten! Try to survive as long as possible and try to score as high as you possibly can.\n\nPick your own challenge in Classic mode\nIn Classic mode you set the challenge. Choose the amount of colors and the speed of the shapes.\n\nTime Attack\nCan you stack efficiently? Prove it in Time Attack mode. Beat the highscore in a set amount of time.\n\nTwo rotation modes\nEkstase can be enjoyed in two different play styles; play style \"A\" and play style \"B\". In A you rotate the colors in a stationary shape, in B you rotate the shapes. This way you get two games for the price of one!\nAccessibility\nAre you colorblind? No worries, I've got you covered! In the options menu, pick your type of color blindness for the appropriate color palette, or hand pick the colors yourself. Motor challenges? No biggie! Ekstase comes with custom button mapping and co-pilot. Do you find the background animations too distracting?! Not a problem! Turn it down, or all the way off, from the options menu.\nIn Raskal's games everyone gets to play.",

Take a victory lap and explore previously beaten levels to discover their liberated state, with plenty of mechanical and environmental changes to uncover. Or take some time off in the hub town taking on sidequests and other distinct challenges instead.\n\u2022\tPull off some clever platforming combinations or get physical with a special physics-driven combat system that ramps up the chaos and fun. Push, pull and spin your enemies out of your way.\n\u2022\tA different take on checkpoints, freeing the player to place them wherever they want. Show off without them for a perfect run, or place one in preparation for a challenging section.\n\u2022\tUnique challenges like the \u201cPhoto Hunt\u201d mode where you\u2019re tasked to take pictures of hidden locations & surprising moments! Or simply take pictures and selfies for fun and share them across all social media!\n\u2022\tAn awesome collection of purchasable mods that can be combined in clever ways to completely change your playstyle! Or you could buy some dyes & pets instead, the world's your oyster!\n\u2022\tTons of carefully crafted levels that constantly introduce new challenges as well as engaging bosses full of character and life! Until Beebz gets to them...\n\nFrom the makers of Slime-san comes their newest creation!

After a long night on the town, Anton, Boiler City's resident exterminator and overconsumer of fizzy libation, is struggling to find his way back home from Brulo's Casino. Using his trusty Antonball, Anton decides to take the most direct path home after an unfortunate trip into the sewers: breaking straight through every single wall between the sewers and the city he calls home in 30 stages of brick-smashing fun!\n\nPUNCHBALL is the tale of Anton's building-mate Annie, and her indefatigable need to be the absolute best. When Annie discovers the Punchball Tourney being held at Brulo's Casino, with the grand prize being a lifetime supply of Ballble Tea, she sets out to win first place! You'll need to help her defeat all of the trickster beasts that have volunteered to take part in Brulo's wild game. Use the Punchball to slam enemies, then kick 'em off the stage! Do you have what it takes to be the Punchball Champion?\n\nVS. ANTONBALL is Antonball but competitive! Each team has their own brick wall and aims to break the other team's wall first. Defeat the other team by destroying their wall! Play 1v1, 2v2, or even 2v1 (if you're into that)! Many power-ups are in play, with some twists and turns depending on which arena you're having your ball-based blitz in! You can even pick some up and throw them!\n\nIncludes the \"BETTER THAN NOTHING\" and \"FIXED GOLD EVIL BABY PAUL (SHINY)\" DLC!",

Key choices you make will bolster one of three convictions\u2014Utility, Morality, Liberty\u2014which together make up Serenoa\u2019s world view and influence how the story will unfold. When faced with truly momentous decisions, multiple characters will weigh in by casting their votes on the Scales of Conviction. In these moments, the allies and decisions you make can determine the fate of whole nations and the continent of Norzelia itself.\n\nControl multi-tiered battlefields to strategically secure victory\n\nFinding the best location in turn-based battles can tip the tide of combat in your favor. Position units on higher ground to take control of the battlefield and gain the advantage with increased range. You can also flank enemies on both sides, then strike from behind for a powerful follow-up attack. Elemental chain reactions are also an important part of combat. For example, use fire to melt icy terrain, then use lightning to electrocute it. Push the enemy into the electrified water to see sparks fly in stunning HD-2D visuals!",

        "description": "DLC Pack 1 \"The Master Trials\" includes the following:\n\nTrial of the Sword\n\nVisit a certain location to challenge the Trial of the Sword, where you must vanquish waves of enemies to progress from one room to the next. You will start this challenge completely bare, without any armor, equipment, or food items to aid you. Once you defeat all the enemies in a room, you can advance to the next. If you complete all 45 rooms, Link's mind and body will be strong enough to wield the Master Sword's full power and splendor any time the sword is usable! \n\nHero's Path Mode\n\nA feature that allows you to view the path you've taken on your journey. It will record your journey for up to 200 hours of gameplay. Use this to find those shrines and Koroks that are still eluding you! You can even adjust the replay speed so you can manually select the pace you wish to watch your path unfold.\n\nMaster Mode\n\nIn Master Mode, most enemies you encounter will be one tier higher than they originally were. For example, where you would normally see red Bokoblins, you will now likely see Blue Bokoblins instead.\n\nThere is also a new top tier of enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode! Additionally, enemies will recover health if you stop attacking them, and they will also notice Link more easily, so you may need to make adjustments to your fighting strategies. You also might find enemies and treasure chests floating in the air! Use these locations to your advantage to score treasure or even recover stamina.\n\nTravel Medallion\n\nThere is an item called the Travel Medallion hidden in a treasure chest somewhere. Place it at your current location and you will be able to travel there whenever you please. You can only register one location at a time, but this addition should aid you in your journey.\n\n8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series (Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor, and Phantom Greaves) will be hidden in 8 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule. There are hints to help you find these items hidden somewhere as well. Search for these hints and treasures while you journey across Hyrule!\n\nKorok Mask\n\nThe Korok Mask is an item that will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere in Hyrule, and unlike the 8 items mentioned above, this one has a special ability. When Link wears this mask, it will shake when a hidden Korok is nearby!",

Once all challenges and trials have been bested, Link will obtain a new power known as the Master Cycle Zero!\n\nAdditionally, the bard Kass is traveling Hyrule to complete the unfinished song his teacher left behind. As Link and Kass chase their respective goals, Kass will share new original songs he wrote capturing lost memories of the four Champions and Zelda, previously unknown to Link. But that unfinished song... What could it be? \n\n*To play The Champions' Ballad, you must first complete the Main Quest to free the four Divine Beasts. \n\n9 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series will be hidden in 9 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule, including the Island Lobster Shirt, Ravio's Hood, Zant's Helmet, Phantom Ganon Skull, Phantom Ganon Armor, Phantom Ganon Greaves, and a Royal Guard outfit (complete with Royal Guard Cap, Royal Guard Uniform, and Royal Guard Boots).\n\nAncient Horse Gear\n\nThe Ancient Bridle will increase a horse's number of spurs while equipped. The Ancient Saddle will allow you to call your horse no matter how far away they are. Both of these items will appear in treasure chests somewhere in Hyrule.",

        "description": "Jayavarman VII leads Khmer and Dyah Gitarja leads Indonesia in Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI! Though each is versatile and unique, both civilizations bring new challengers to the religious game. Indonesia is a strong coastal civilization with potential for a huge Jong-powered navy, and the Khmer thrive in their populous riverside cities. Both of these civilizations come into play in the new \u201cPath to Nirvana\u201d scenario, where you compete to have the most followers of your religion on a unique Southeast Asia map. \n\nIncludes the Khmer civilization with Jayavarman VII, the Domrey unique unit, and the Prasat unique improvement.\n\n\u2022 Civ Unique Ability: The \u201cGrand Barays\u201d ability gives Khmer additional food when Farms are built next to Aqueducts, and Aqueducts provide both Faith and an Amenity. \n\n\u2022 Leader Unique Ability: Jayavarman\u2019s \u201cMonasteries of the King\u201d ability lets Khmer grab adjacent territory as well as Food and Housing when Holy Sites are built on a river. \n\n\u2022 Unique Unit: The Domrey, a ballista mounted on an elephant, is stronger than a Catapult, can move and shoot on the same turn, and exerts Zone of Control. \n\n\u2022 Unique Building: The Prasat replaces the Temple and provides a Relic Great Work slot. Missionaries that are produced here gain a new attribute when killed in religious combat: they generate a Relic.\n\nAlso includes the Indonesian civilization with Dyah Gitarja, the Jong unique unit, and the Kampung unique improvement:\n\n\u2022 Civ Unique Ability: With the \u201cGreat Nusantara\u201d ability, Coastal Tiles provide Indonesia with minor adjacency bonuses for certain districts and Entertainment Complexes give an extra Amenity if they are adjacent to a non-lake Coastal Tile.\n\n\u2022 Leader Unique Ability: Gitarja has the \u201cExalted Goddess of the Three Worlds\u201d ability, granting bonus Faith to coastal cities and allowing her to purchase Naval units with Faith at a discount, as well as eliminating movement cost for Religious unit to embark or disembark.\n\n\u2022 Unique Unit: Indonesia\u2019s unique unit is the Jong, which replaces the Frigate. It is faster, gains extra combat power if it\u2019s in a formation, and all of the units in its formation gain its movement speed. \n\n\u2022 Unique Improvement: The Kampung provides Housing, Production and Food for each adjacent Fishing Boat, and can be improved through further tech research later in the game. \n\nNew \u201cPath to Nirvana\u201d Scenario:\n\u2022 The lands around the Indian Ocean flourish with many religions and many people. Heaven has chosen you to bring the light to all these lands. Is your faith up to the challenge? In this 50 turn scenario, compete to have the most followers of your religion, the most faith per turn, and the most foreign cities following your religion.\n\nNew Wonder:\n\u2022 Angkor Wat: The largest religious monument in the world returns to Civilization! This temple must be built adjacent to an Aqueduct and provides Faith, plus it adds Housing and a Citizen to every one of the owner\u2019s cities when built.\n\nNew Natural Wonder:\n\u2022 Ha Long Bay: This breathtaking bay was designated one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2012, and provides Food, Production, and Culture, in addition to providing a large combat bonus to naval units in its tiles.\n\nNew Map:\n\u2022 Spread your empire through Southeast Asia in this new map, with a True Start and random location option.",

        "description": "Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we\u2019ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here\u2019s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it\u2019s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n\nFeatures:\nNew levels: You\u2019ve got a new level that\u2019s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who\u2019s finished the game at least once. You\u2019ve got another (poorly) hidden level, for the masochists who know that there is a Boss Cell 5\nNew Bosses: Mirroring the above, you\u2019ve got a new completely different type of boss available in the main level structure, with another INSANELY difficult boss hidden behind even more ridiculously difficult content.\nNew content: There are 10 new enemies, 13 new weapons/skills and a bunch of other upgrades to core game systems. There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and\u2026\nSkins: People have been requesting this for ages and we\u2019ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accommodate the request. You\u2019ve now got access to female skins, fluo skins and a Christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.\n\nOn top of these major changes we\u2019re continuously trying to update the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we\u2019re not done, we\u2019ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you\u2019d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.",

        "intro": "Build Your Greatest Empire on Nintendo Switch\u2122",
        "description": "Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI Expansion Bundle, which combines both Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, takes the turn-based strategy classic to new heights. With 16 new civilizations, 18 new leaders, and major enhancements to gameplay such as Great Ages and an active planet where geology and climatology present unique new challenges, the pursuit of building the greatest empire becomes as exciting as it has ever been in the Civilization franchise.\n\nThe Civilization VI Expansion Bundle contains all features from the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, that includes: \n\n\u2022NEW LEADERS AND CIVS: Combined together, sixteen new civilizations and eighteen new leaders are introduced. Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as unique units, districts, wonders, buildings, and more. \n\n\u2022GREAT AGES: As your civilization ebbs and flows and you reach milestone Historic Moments, you will move towards Dark Ages or Golden Ages, each providing specific challenges or bonuses based on your actions in game. Rise triumphantly from a Dark Age, and your next Golden Age will be even stronger \u2013 a Heroic Age.\n\n\u2022LOYALTY: Cities now have individual Loyalty to your leadership \u2013 let it fall too low, and face the consequences of low yields, revolts, and the potential to lose your city if it declares its own independence. But one civilization\u2019s loss can be your gain as you inspire Loyalty among cities throughout the map and further expand your borders.\n\n\u2022GOVERNORS: Recruit, appoint, and upgrade powerful characters with unique specialization bonuses and promotion trees to customize your cities, and reinforce Loyalty.\n\n\u2022ENHANCED ALLIANCES: An enhanced alliances system allows players to form different types of alliances and build bonuses over time.\n\n\u2022EMERGENCIES: When a civilization grows too powerful, other civilizations can join a pact against the threatening civilization, and earn rewards, or penalties, when the Emergency ends.\n\n\u2022TIMELINE: Review your civilization\u2019s history at any time with the new Timeline feature, a visual journey through the Historic Moments that you encountered on your path to victory. \n\n\u2022ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sandstorms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts bring the world to life in a brand-new way. Your settlement choices are more important than ever as you balance high risks and high rewards. \n\n\u2022POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES: Strategic resources play an additional role. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you\u2019ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world\u2019s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. \n\n\u2022ENGINEERING PROJECTS: Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles.\n\n\u2022WORLD CONGRESS: Make your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory. \n\n\u202221st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES & CIVICS: A new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions.",

        "description": "Explore a relaxing Arboretum, wade through a noxious Swamp and take on a new boss in this new early game content designed to expand the Dead Cells universe and add variety to runs for people who want to support the development of the game.\n\nSo you\u2019ll be able to play through:\n- The Dilapidated Arboretum: A relaxing and peaceful greenhouse inhabited by a peaceful clan of mushrooms, with an understandable desire to murder the Beheaded.\n- The Morass of the Banished: A noxious environment ruled by a band of tree dwelling mutants with pointy sticks, sneaky dart shooting frogmen and a bunch of deadly bloodsuckers.\n- The Nest: Domain of Mama Tick.\n\nThe two new levels and their monsters are alternatives to Promenade of the Condemned/Toxic Sewers and Ramparts/Ossuary/Ancient Sewers, with the boss designed to be on par with The Concierge, so hopefully it\u2019ll spice up your early game runs once you\u2019ve played through the core game.\n\nWhy Paid DLC?\n\nWe\u2019ve been releasing free updates for Dead Cells for over a year now, this paid DLC is designed to support that effort, allow us to expand the game even more and ensure that Motion Twin have the time they need to make their next game one they\u2019ll be proud of and you\u2019ll be stoked to play.\n\nAs usual we\u2019re going to do this right, so if you\u2019re not happy with the cost of the DLC, the quality of the update or have suggestions, ideas for other ways of continuing to pay for the team or anything at all, leave us a review.",

After a wide slash, Sephiroth unleashes an incredible explosion that deals damage and sometimes status effects! With his Masamune blade in hand and destruction on his mind, Sephiroth is a force to be reckoned with.\n",

Kazuya\u2019s fighting style captures the distinct style of the Tekken series as he gets up close and personal with heavy strikes and incredible comeback power. His specials tap into his Devil Gene with moves like the beam-shooting Devil Blaster and high-flying Devil Wings. The son of Tekken icon Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya has a chip on his shoulder and destructive power.\n\nWhat makes Kazuya Mishima unique in this game are his standard attacks\u2014rather than 4 directional standard attacks, he has 8. This addition of diagonal inputs mimics his abilities in the Tekken games and make him an unpredictable fighter with a lot of combo options. The stage added with this fighter is the Mishima Dojo, which starts out with all four directions closed off. A strong launch or direct attack can shatter the walls and ceilings, allowing for opponents to get KO\u2019d. \n\nTekken rated TEEN by the ESRB. \n\n",

That's Tooki's motto. Always taking on new recruits under her wing, Tooki brings the team to new heights. Just be careful when she invites you out to lunch; her bill is always enormous!\n\nCoco: Coco is one tough nut to crack. Raised in a family of fifty noisy brothers, he enjoys a quiet evening alone on the beach with nothing but his thoughts and stamp collection. But get Coco talking about tropical furniture and he'll open right up!\n\nGilly: There are plenty of fish in the sea, but none are quite as bubbly as Gilly! Born into royalty, she escaped her family's sandcastle to live out her dreams as a furniture mover. Well, that's what she tells everyone around the water cooler. Though the tale does sound a bit fishy...\n\nClawdius: This busy little administrator loves filling out paperwork and signing forms, but when there's boxes to move in a pinch, Clawdius will scuttle right to the forefront! You can find him at night naming all the constellations.\n\nSo buckle up, slap on some sunscreen and sail on over to Packmore Island for Movers in Paradise!",

This time, you are in charge of inviting characters as clients and helping them live out their own dream vacations. Choose from a variety of islands, with different terrain and climates and find one that matches your client\u2019s vision. Then start designing and start making their vacation dreams come true. Just wait until you see the look on your clients\u2019 faces after you reveal the vacation home decorated just for them.\n\nAdd personalized touches to your client\u2019s resort island\n\nCustomize everything from home exteriors and interiors, the yard and even customize the weather to either be sunny or rainy. Handpick the picture-book spot for your resort creation and use the Paradise Planning team\u2019s expansive inventory to deck out vacation homes without being limited to your own inventory, recipes, or resources. The editing tools make decorating a snap! It\u2019s a breeze to go back and redecorate as you like, so change and rearrange to your heart\u2019s content.  \n\nAs you design more vacation homes for your clients, facilities like cafes and schools around the Paradise Planning office will open up. Decorate these into inviting locales, choose roles for different characters, then watch your clients spend time together. Why not stop by and check in to see how things are going in paradise?\n\nYou can up your design game on your own island, too! Design options that you acquire while working as a Paradise Planning team member can be used on your island as they become available. Build partition walls and pillars, set the mood with lighting, and add soundscapes to both your residents\u2019 homes as well as your own.\n\nShare your masterpieces with friends\n\nTake in-game photos of your designs and add them to your portfolio. Show them to other characters and you may get more requests to create vacation homes! Share the photos with other players using the in-game Showroom* in the Happy Home Network app and they can tour your personally-designed resort islands or go tour theirs for some relaxation and inspiration.

        "description": "The expansion pass includes DLC Pack 1: The Master Trials and DLC Pack 2: The Champions' Ballad.\n\nExpansion Pass Bonus\n\u2022 Three treasure chests with in-game clothing exclusive to the expansion pass will be added to the Great Plateau.\n\nDLC Pack 1: The Master Trials will include the following:\n\nTrial of the Sword\nVisit a certain location to challenge the Trial of the Sword, where you must vanquish waves of enemies to progress from one room to the next. You will start this challenge without any armor, equipment, or food items to aid you. If you complete all 45 rooms, Link's mind and body will be strong enough to wield the Master Sword's full power and splendor any time the sword is usable! \n\nHero's Path Mode\nView the path you've taken on your journey. It will record your journey for up to 200 hours of gameplay. Use this feature to find shrines and Koroks! You can even manually adjust the replay speed.\n\nMaster Mode\nIn Master Mode, most enemies you encounter will be one tier higher than they originally were. There is also a new top tier of enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode! Additionally, enemies will recover health if you stop attacking them, and they will also notice Link more easily. You also might find enemies and treasure chests floating in the air!\n\nTravel Medallion\nThe Travel Medallion will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere. Place it at your current location and you will be able to travel there whenever you please. You can only register one location at a time, but this addition should aid you in your journey.\n\n8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series (Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor, and Phantom Greaves) will be hidden in 8 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule. There are hints to help you find these items hidden somewhere as well. Search for these hints and treasures while you journey across Hyrule!\n\nKorok Mask\nThe Korok Mask is an item that will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere in Hyrule, and unlike the 8 items mentioned above, this one has a special ability. When Link wears this mask, it will shake when a hidden Korok is nearby!\n\nDLC Pack 2: The Champions' Ballad will include the following:\n\nThe Champions' Ballad\nA mysterious voice beckons Link to challenge the Divine Beast Tamer's Trials. He must now prove himself by defeating enemies using the One-Hit Obliterator, conquering new Shrines, challenging a full dungeon, and overcoming many trials along the way. Once all challenges and trials have been bested, Link will obtain a new power known as the Master Cycle Zero!\n\nAdditionally, the bard Kass is traveling Hyrule to complete the unfinished song his teacher left behind. As Link and Kass chase their respective goals, Kass will share new original songs he wrote capturing lost memories of the four Champions and Zelda, previously unknown to Link. But that unfinished song... What could it be? \n\n*To play The Champions' Ballad, you must first complete the Main Quest to free the four Divine Beasts. \n\n9 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series will be hidden in 9 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule, including the Island Lobster Shirt, Ravio's Hood, Zant's Helmet, Phantom Ganon Skull, Phantom Ganon Armor, Phantom Ganon Greaves, and a Royal Guard outfit (complete with Royal Guard Cap, Royal Guard Uniform, and Royal Guard Boots).\n\nAncient Horse Gear\nThe Ancient Bridle will increase a horse's number of spurs while equipped. The Ancient Saddle will allow you to call your horse no matter how far away they are. Both of these items will appear in treasure chests somewhere in Hyrule.",

        "description": "The Season pass will deliver 3 extra portions of content, featuring more meals, more mechanics and more mayhem!\n\nFirst Course (Out Now): Campfire Cook Off\n\nIt\u2019s time for some camping capers as you take a road trip through the forests of the Onion Kingdom. Joining Kevin and the Onion King are 4 new chefs that are right at home in the wooded kitchens; Scout Chef, Bear Chef, Beaver Chef and the bespectacled Owl Chef\n\nYou\u2019ll need to chop wood to keep the fires burning as you fry up a hearty breakfast, or toast tasty S\u2019mores across 15 new levels set amongst tree-tops and tents. New levels of co-operation will be needed for the new wearable backpacks that hold the ingredients the team of chefs need to serve the hungry campers.\n\nSecond Course (Out Now) : Night of the Hangry Horde\n\nOvercooked! 2: Night of the Hangry Horde sees players face the most terrifying threat to the Onion Kingdom yet, the unbread, and this time they\u2019ve brought friends! This DLC introduces an entirely new horde mode in which players must use all of their cooking know how to repel waves of ravenous undead ingredients.\n\nEight horde mode levels see players face up against waves of undead enemy attackers including the unbread, giant zombie apples and swift zombie chili peppers.\n\nPlus 12 new levels! Nine new kitchens and three hidden Kevin levels.\n\nFour new chefs! Vampire chef, Ghost chef, Werewolf chef and returning favourite Boxhead chef from Overcooked!\n\nNew mechanics! The guillotine is an efficient new way to chop ingredients and the furnace must be fueled with coal in order to roast your dinners\n\nThree recipes! Fruit pies, soup and roast dinners.\n\nThird Course (Out Now) : Carnival of Chaos\n\nOvercooked! 2 Carnival of Chaos invites players to a celebration of all things cooking, co-op and chaos! This colourful new DLC will put players to the test as you take on combo meals and that kitchen essential, the canon!\n\nCanons!  An unconventional kitchen requires unconventional means of transport. Chefs must load themselves into the canon and fly through the air with the greatest of ease.\n\nCombo Meals! For extra hungry customers, players must combine cuisines on a trusty tray, topped off with a refreshing beverage. \n\nNew Recipes! Hot dogs and everyone's favourite circular food, the mighty donut, join the menu!\n\nSauces! Is it even possible to have a hot dog without ketchup or mustard\u2026or both?!\n\nPlus 15 New Levels! Players will burn burgers in the big top and tackle tasty treats on a tight rope in a series of vibrant new levels.\n\nFour New Chefs! A quartet of colourful characters join the culinary chaos: Ringmaster Chef, Strongman Chef, Clown Chef and Stunt Chef!",
