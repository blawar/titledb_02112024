Collect as many eggs as possible to use them as ammo to blast your oppon- I mean, friends away! Only the most skilled player -or luckiest, we\u2019re not so sure- will be the last one standing! Up to four players can join the fun.\n\nArcade mode: Hatch as many ducklings as possible to always go deeper and deeper into the Grid of Infinity. Lead them to safe zones, watch out for walls and enemies, and get the highest score possible! But truth be told, your worst enemy here is yourself\u2026\n\nNostalgia mode: Tired of all that modern and neon-ish art? Let\u2019s dive into some good ol\u2019 30s atmosphere! Gather the number of ducklings required to finish each level! If you\u2019re quick enough, you\u2019ll get a bonus by getting them all before the goat can eat the flower! Yes, because there is a whole menagerie in this game.\n\nLaboratory: Solve the puzzles in as few moves as you can to get the best result! You won\u2019t be able to stop moving unless you hit a wall, so watch out where you\u2019re going!",

Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!\n\nEverything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia\u2019s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot to mine the world\u2019s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.\n\nThe stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron\u2019s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron\u2019s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia\u2019s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she\u2019s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it\u2019s too late. \n\nOur hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Baron\u2019s Digsites before it\u2019s too late...\n\nKey Features\n\u2022\tStunning visuals - Intricate pixel art aesthetic inspired by retro classics\n\u2022\tExplore the world of Sparklite - Five beautiful, procedurally generated biomes\n\u2022\tInvent your arsenal - Invent gadgets to solve puzzles and defeat enemies\n\u2022\tBattle bosses - Take on the Baron Mining Corp and its formidable gremlin Titans\n\u2022\tMeet the locals - Befriend the people of Geodia and help build The Refuge\n\u2022\tHunt collectibles - Discover collectibles scattered throughout the world\n\u2022\tBuddy up! - Rescue Ada\u2019s robotic sidekick to play local assistive co-op with a friend",

Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Always keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet.\n- Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late.\n- Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new.\n- Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks.\n- A completely new end of the world from Finji (Canabalt, Night in the Woods).",

You\u2019ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!\n\nJason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses.

Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. \n\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim.

        "intro": "Ancient civilizations compete to be the first to reach the sky.",
        "description": "Ages ago, the gods contacted several civilizations all around the world. But since then, they remained silent. Now they need to hear our calls.\n\nDivine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.\n\nSix of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they've elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible.\n\nKey Features:\n\n    Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes\n    Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.)\n    Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents\n    Special moves\n    Tile-based isometric 3D graphics\n    Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design\n\nGame mechanics:\n\nThe game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.\n\nThe player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.\n\nEach turn, the player has two move options:\n\n    The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.\n    You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.\n\nSpecial moves:\n\n    If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.\n    If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.\n    If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.\n\nThere are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.\n\nGame modes:\n\nThere are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.\n\n    Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.\n    Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones. The player has a limited amount of moves to build a single temple, whether alone or against opponents in later stages.",

        "description": "Ever wished to play as one of the characters from your favourite horror movies? Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 multiplayer game that allows you to choose between playing an unstoppable Killer and one of four Survivors trying to evade a gruesome death. This edition includes 9 killers and 10 survivors to choose from and 3 cosmetic packs.\n\nSURVIVE TOGETHER\u2026 OR NOT - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?\n\nA FEAST FOR KILLERS - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer, you can play as anything from a powerful slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your killing grounds and master each Killer\u2019s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. This deadly game of cat and mouse also lets you meet some of the most iconic Killers and Survivors from horror franchises.\n\nDEEPER AND DEEPER - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.\n\nREAL PEOPLE, REAL FEAR - The unique levels and real human reactions to pure horror make each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it\u2019s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what\u2019s hiding in The Fog.",

        "description": "Love is a universal feeling, but each of us experiences it in a different way. Solo: Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences. \n\nThe world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.\n\nAs with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island. \n\nNature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

You touch a block with a detonator and the entire chain explodes.  The blocks above them drop, another detonator touches, and another chain is gone.  Then another.\n\nAnode reintroduces the classic falling-block puzzle genre, with new twists and challenges!  Link blocks back and forth across each other.  Match angled couplers to create chains of multiple colors.  Earn items and use them to clear your bin.  Play Mission Mode and complete randomly-generated objectives for additional challenge.  Post your scores on leaderboards and see how you stack up.\n\nInvite a friend over, plug in some controllers, and dive into frantic competition.  Complete long chains to send blocks to your opponent's side, or use offensive items to trip them up.  All to a pulsing soundtrack with music that gets more intense as your bin fills!",

Care for their constant development, train, sign advertising contracts and be active in social media. Thousands of fans aren\u2019t going to come to you on their own, you have to work for it.\n\nAchieving success in league matches and winning first place requires continuous training. The whole team needs to obtain skills, not just a single player.

Expand it, share new premises and install additional items for use. The players must also train at the gym, play, relax and have meals. All these elements have a direct impact on the games in the league.\n\nBefore league matches conduct sparing with other teams, to prepare the appropriate tactics. In sparing you can test different combinations of Special Skills, select weapons, behavior and observe their impact on the game.\n\nStart in Sponsored Tournaments to gain experience and earn cash prizes.\n\nTo reach the very top there is hard work and loads of matches to play.\n\nGame features:\n- two game modes (FPS, MOBA)\n- 3 leagues in each match mode\n- 48 different teams in each League\n- 40 special skills for each member of the team\n- 20 special skills for each team\n- 25 weapon types\n- 12 types of heroes in MOBA\n- 9 rooms in the team base with the possibility to expand\n- 142 items of equipment to purchase\n- 69 Sponsored Tournaments\n- unlimited number of advertising contracts ",

        "intro": "Contraptions is a physics based puzzle game with a fun cartoony look and feel to it.",
        "description": "How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for \"Contraptions\" - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.\n\nUse camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.\n\nFeatures\n+ Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.\n+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\n+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.\n+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\n\nGameplay\nOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.\n\nThis can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a \u201ccontraption\u201d which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become. ",

        "description": "Life at the convent school isn't easy for Lilli. Only her vivid imagination lets the shy girl escape everyday-drudgery under the stern, watchful eye of the Mother Superior. She diligently works through her chores, no matter how unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any resentment, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable shell of sweetness.\nAnd if anything goes awry or gets ugly, the jolly censorship gnomes got her back: they put a nice coat of pink paint over all the things Lili would rather not consciously confront. But are her little potato-shaped budies real or just a figment of her vivid subconscious? Maybe it's only a matter of time until she completely loses her mind!\nWhen her best friend Edna disappears under mysterious circumstances, Lili bravely sets out on a dangerous journey, not only to get her friend back, but also to confront her subconscious fears.",

        "description": "Unforgiving and tense, each mission tells a story of two police operatives - John Rimes and Rick Jones, filled with infiltrating gang hideouts, rescuing hostages, making arrests and other life-threatening situations.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2013 The Surrender System allows you to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence. Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.\n\n\u2013 Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return. \n\n\u2013 Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.\n\n\u2013 As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.\n\n\u2013 Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.\n\n\u2013 Complex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.\n\n\u2013 All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!\n\n\u2013 Local Co-op. Complete missions together for better scores and more fun!",

        "description": "Share a heart-to-heart talk, watch a movie together, take a bath, remove a computer virus, help a girl in a tough spot and - if you're lucky - find the love of your life using the color and pattern of her panties. Pantsu Hunter: Back to the 90s is an adventure game with point-n-click elements (with a risk of swift loss) that tells the story about a guy looking for love renovated in a nostalgic 80s and 90s anime style.\n\nKenji Kojima, a young and able enthusiast, leaves his home province to attend university in the capital. Without the help of his parents, it\u2019s difficult to live and study, so he begins learning different occupations until he eventually becomes a true handyman. However, academic qualifications aren\u2019t his priority in life - it\u2019s finding true love! Unfortunately, it\u2019s not that simple. To his aid have come the most unexpected of all things: Panties! Kenji has learned how to identify a girl's personality by her underwear and he\u2019ll meet four girls on his way: a playful sweetheart, a pretty tomboy, a shy introvert and an icy beauty. Can he eventually find his true love?\n\nFeatures:\n- Nostalgic and unique 80s and 90s anime-like style\n- Animated backgrounds and female character faces \n- Original soundtrack created with the help of an old synthesizer\n- English voicing\n- 18 panties for your collection\n- A variety of unforeseeable endings. Be careful!\n- 9 Extra Scenes disclosing the heroines' past\n\nWe very carefully approached the realization of this style. Our game is supposed to give you this wonderful feeling of pure and undisturbed romance and to dip you into this beautiful nostalgic era.",

But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?",

        "description": "Risk versus reward guides your journey through the full-length single player campaign and local/online multiplayer. Vigilance is key as environmental tells such as footprints and other disturbances will point out careless cadets. A massive amount of lovingly-made environments, maps, modes, and abilities \u2013 all obsessively balanced \u2013 combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.\n\n\u2605 Single Player Campaigns\nChallenge yourself in the Hero\u2019s Journey: individually tailored hero campaigns filled with puzzle rooms, skill challenges, and boss fights. The unique abilities have entire journeys built specifically to teach you to properly use that hero\u2019s playstyle \u2013 all while the art of stealth and mastery of movement becomes second-nature.\n\n\u2605 Battle Online\nOnce you\u2019ve honed your skills in the Hero\u2019s Journey and defeated all of your friends, you\u2019ll want to challenge the world! Online matchmaking, crossplay with the PC community, and public or private matches with join keys allow you to find a foe anytime, anywhere.\n\n\u2605 Choose your Main\nWith 12 different heroes \u2013 each with their own unique ability \u2013 there is a perfect strategy for every playstyle. From meticulously sneaky to ruthlessly aggressive, find your favorite ability and shock your friends when you appear out of thin air and surprise them!\n\n\u2605 Competitive, Deep Hide and Seek\nCount your steps to find the perfect hiding spot, wait for your foes to reveal themselves, then pounce! While counterintuitive at first, invisibility becomes your most versatile tool, leading to intense moments of complete silence. Invisigun\u2019s core mechanics reward patience, forethought, trickery, and awareness.\n\n\u2605 Easy to Learn, Tough to Master\nThe depth is nearly unlimited with intentional baits, undetectable direction changes, powerup drops, and accidental bumps (that may not be so accidental). The chess dance is infinite and evolving, and all of the deceit is only heightened by the fact that your opponents could be lurking ANYWHERE!",

This 2D sidescrolling exploration platformer follows the adventure of Erina, whose humdrum life as a regular rabbit is turned upside-down when she finds herself in an unknown world and turned into a human (with rabbit ears)!\nAlong the way she meets the cheerful pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stay by Erina\u2019s side.\nThese unwitting heroes embark together on their quest to restore Erina\u2019s life to normalcy, but who knows what troubles lurk, waiting for them\u2026\n\n\u25cfExplore! Plaform! Your own adventure!\n\nRabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay. There will be hints to guide the player along, but they\u2019re never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom to\u2014you guessed it\u2014explore.\nPlayers will play as our protagonist Erina, who focuses on close quarters combat. Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina\u2019s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.\n\n\nErina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn\u2019t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.\n\nBoth Erina and Ribbon\u2019s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.\nWhat trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?\n\n\u25cfFeatures\n\n\u2013 Retro exploration platformer featuring a bunny girl.\n\u2013 4+n difficulty settings for all types of players.\n\u2013 9+ main areas and 20+ sub-areas to explore.\n\u2013 Bunny.\n\u2013 Over 60 items and upgrades.\n\u2013 Over 20 fully illustrated characters with cutscene illustrations.\n\u2013 40+ boss battles, 1000+ attack patterns with Boss Rush Mode to fight some or all of them in a row.\n\u2013 Post game story and content with speedrun mode which takes out every section of the game where the player cannot control the main character.\n\u2013 Over 50+ pieces from an original soundtrack.\n\u2013 English, Chinese and Japanese support.\n\u2013 Bunny.",

Adventuring, exploring ruins, accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world\u2026 you\u2019ve done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he\u2019s a bit fed up with the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he\u2019s in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that\u2019s not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement. Specially when you\u2019re trying to keep a dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one complex.\n\n-Explore a world of possibilities in a fully-realized fantasy realm. And one of those world map things we used to love.\n\n-Face huge bosses, dangerous foes, and angsty teenagers.\n\n-Find tons of parodies and pop culture references. Let's see if you can recognise them all.\n\n-Save the world. Sorta. Granted, it's a bit of a clich\u00e9. But hey, it works.\n\n-Unlock special abilities and upgrade basic combo movements with an all-powerful \u201cfinal blow\u201d-type move.\n\n-Evade the cruel and overrated real world with a long single player campaign. \n\n-Well, not as long as that one with the guy with the white hair, SURE, but we're an indie studio, dammit!",

Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?\n\nAfter work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech? \n\nOn the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs. \n\nBut every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash? \n\nAfter good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.

        "description": "After abandoning her high-powered tech career and a mysterious three-year absence, Evelyn Ishino-Aubrey resurfaces working as a proxy for a virtual counseling app called Eliza. Her job consists solely of reading a script provided to her in real-time by an AI, leaving her no autonomy over what she says. Is Eliza a technological marvel that brings therapy to those who otherwise couldn\u2019t access it? Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control over our lives and humanity?\n\nAs she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument\u2014 and as she begins to question everything about her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.\n\n\u2022 A thought-provoking story told in the form of a visual novel from an award-winning indie team.\n\n\u2022 Follow Evelyn\u2019s journey through a present-day Seattle brought to life with beautiful hand-painted art.\n\n\u2022 Get to know Eliza\u2019s clients and the employees of Skandha, the technology giant behind it, with over a dozen fully-voiced characters and powerful performances from a highly regarded cast.\n\n\u2022 An evocative, ambient original score by the composer for Infinifactory, SHENZHEN I/O, Opus Magnum, and EXAPUNKS.\n\n\u2022 Is AI-driven counseling better than nothing? Is it worse than nothing? What responsibilities come with technical skills? Consider your own answers to these questions and more.\n\n\u2022 Counseling sessions getting a little too real? Relax with Kabufuda Solitaire, a new take on solitaire using Japanese kabufuda cards.",

It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\n\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT\u2019s polished, minimalist visual language helps you focus on what's most important \u2013 the fluid gameplay and the cinematic beauty of the fight.\n\nSUPERHOT features:\n\u2022 Endless Mode \u2013 how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?\n\u2022 Challenge Mode \u2013 take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.\n\u2022 Extras \u2013 delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].\n\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.",

The Lings, your workers, will obey you and help you with your village. But beware, they can cause a lot of problems too. If this is not enough, there are other creatures that will try to do the same, they can trade, fight or help you. Oh, don't forget about the weather and some unexpected events.\n\nVILLAGE BUILDING\n\nBuild your own village with many types of buildings, you need to decide what kind of objects, items or workbench you want inside. There are more than 150 items to craft. Every item and object has a reason. For example, craft a Wood Cabinet and put it inside the houses to increase your storage space. Roads can make them walk faster... and more.\n\nYOUR WORKERS\n\nThe Lings works for you. You need to provide basic salary, food, clothes and a \"\"healthy\"\" environment. It's up to you to decide how they work and where. Beware, they can start conflicts with each other and even set your village on fire. Watch them talk and keep your eyes open for their stats. Each one has unique traits and also attributes that you can control.\n\nDISCOVER\n\nSandbox maps with random generated nature based on your initial profile. Custom maps that you can build yourself. Talk, trade or fight with other races. Collect treasures and sell it or use it on your community. Random events that can turn your whole village into a nightmare from day to night. See how weather impacts your food and workers.\n\nAND MORE!\n\nRain and snow will change not only the visuals, but how you will handle your village. Craft better clothes or they can get sick. Craft better weapons and armors to face evil creatures or random thieves. Accept contracts and make enough Surplus (our currency) to make your community bigger. And, if everything goes wrong (or bad for you), you can just sell the village!\n\nWELCOME TO COMMUNITY INC!",

Problem is, the path is broken in several places!\nTo ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged.\n\nSeems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required!\n\nYou just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive.\n\nBear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nFEATURES:\n\u2013 the game was developed specifically with Nintendo Switch\u2122 in mind\n\u2013 it mixes puzzle and arcade game mechanics\n\u2013 the game requires strategic planning, precision, and quick reflexes\n\u2013 comfortable controls using the accelerometer\n\u2013 dynamic score\n\u2013 beautiful graphics, dynamic lights and special effects\n\u2013 over 50 levels",

The question in this case appears simple enough:  was a security guard's death a suicidal plunge, or maybe an unfortunate fall? \nThe residents of the island - the Bradford family - at first seem cordial and beyond reproach, even shocked by the death of a friendly employee. But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that they harbor animosities and deep hidden motives. The more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations on it, the more complicated and unclear the matter becomes. A seemingly routine case turns into a tale of machinations driven by greed and a suicide investigation reveals multiple murders.\nIs anyone innocent? Will you be able to predict the assassin's next step?",

        "description": "Welcome to the police department, where working late can lead to tragic consequences. You're John Bishop, a swamped-with-work detective who tirelessly carries out your investigations late into the night. But tonight you are pulled from your precious few hours of rest ,and a strange dream, by a mysterious call from an old \u201cfriend.\u201d Turning your fight to find the truth into a fight to survive the night.\n\nYour police department is left without electricity. The security system has been hacked. All exits are locked. But that is not the real problem.\nSomeone\u2026 something is following you. Red eyes shine from dark corners and the sound of shifting, clanking metal echoes through the once safe halls.. You know them simply as animatronics, but something unknown and horrifying is driving them. Figure out what is going on, survive the night, and remember - no one will care if you scream.\n\nFEATURES:\n- A tablet to watch the security cameras carefully. You will use a tablet to watch the security cameras, and you need to be seriously careful. Using the environment of the police station is the key to salvation and survival. Be quiet, be alert, move fast. Your only tools, the only things you can rely on, are your legs, your tablet, and a torch.\n- Hide & Sneak. Use closets and cabinets to sneak between animatronics and try to catch a silent breath.\n- Animatronics. The steel legs and arms will treat you well. Get ready to be confused by their abilities. Be prepared to react to the unexpected.\n- Figure out what\u2019s happening. Explore the police department in search of explanations. Don\u2019t forget to listen to the world around you and keep track of the changes around. The only one that can save your life, is you.",

Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies, cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.\n \nYour mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures\u2026 and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.",

All you need is six minutes, two players, one Nintendo Switch\u2122, half a brain, and ample room for confusion.\n\nTalk It Out is a co-operative guessing game with a twist. Pick up your Nintendo Switch\u2122, grab a friend, and start \u201ctalking\u201d. You need to figure out what your co-player is seeing. Ask a question, get an answer. Simple enough, right?\n\nNot when your choice of questions is\u2026 less than co-operative. And the answers seem to make no sense. So choose wisely, and try to read between the lines. Because what is communication without interpretation? Bound to fail, that\u2019s what!\n\nWe should probably mention you\u2019re on a timer, too. No pressure.\n\nTalk It Out features:\nOdd questions and downright rude responses\nShort game rounds for quick coffee break fun\n2 additional unlockable item packs\n3 difficulty settings (because who wants to win ALL the time?)\n6 character choices that affect gameplay\nA chance to make new friends!\nTons of opportunity for misunderstanding and losing friends!\nA cat with underwear on its head for some reason\n",

        "description": "Soul Searching is a narrative survival game where you control a lone traveler who sails from homeland to an endless sea. On the way, you\u2019ll visit different islands, discover stories of their people, and learn about souls and dragons. \n\nAt its core, this title is all about surviving in a hostile world as a peaceful traveler. You must deal with hunger, thirst, and energy. You can fish, customize your boats and even cast magic spells. There is no one single correct way to play. Discover every mystery of this world on your own. You might get lost, but it won\u2019t take too long to find your way in the end. \n\nOutside the gameplay, the main goal is to think about your life. Soul Searching conveys feelings that rarely appear in games. It deals with themes like growing up, isolation, search for meaning, and direction. It\u2019s a personal expedition deep into your soul.\n\nOutside the main story, you can try a multiplayer in the random mode where up to 4 players work together on generated maps. More players mean more resources needed to survive - cooperation is vital. Also, there are seven other short stories that experiment with different ideas about gameplay and storytelling. Be sure to check them out; you may find them exciting and innovative. \n\nFeatures: \n\n- Single-player mode with a deep and emotional story.\n- Random mode for 1 to 4 players that randomly generates a map and requires players to work together to survive.\n- Creatures at sea: dragons, killer whales, and more.\n- Many islands, some inhabited with lots of people who have intriguing stories to tell.\n- Magic skills that let you survive at sea more easily.\n- Player appearance customization.\n- A day-and-night cycle that affects the gameplay subtly.\n- Bonus short stories with an experimental vibe. \n",

The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\u00e9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging.\n\nThe player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.\n\nEver wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine\nSave Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that's right - Hell! It's not the place it used to be - Hell's been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people. They've turned your precious homeland into a madhouse, and only you can stop them! What's in it for you? Spectacular locations, battles with epic bosses and a nice mixture of pain and nonsense.\n\nChoose the right side of evil and rescue your \"princess\" - the most badass dare-deviless Hell has ever seen.\n\nThe game contains graphic violence, blood and gore.",

        "description": "Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind Games.\n\nPsychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton\u2019s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary\u2019s true intentions, the dread begins.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nRemothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.\n\n- Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action, strategic, hide \u2018n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and his path. Don\u2019t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.\n\n- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.\n\n- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.\nAudio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.\n\n- No health bars - Your body is the only way to understand how you are doing.\n\n- Realistic puzzles - Environments and characters have been conceived to be realistic and credible.\n\n- Top-notch soundtrack - Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni wrote the music for the game.\n\n- Real-time loading - Explore the mansion without worrying about empty moments or boring loading times.\n\nIn addition, the Nintendo Switch\u2122 version of the game presents these extra features:\n\n- A free integrated Artbook that players will unlock the first time they finish the game. This Artbook will contain the characters, locations and storyboard sequences\u2019 concept art, collected items during the game, wireframes and 3D models of the mansion and characters.\n\n- Controller\u2019s vibration.\n\n- Spatialized audio.",

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout.\n\nIt's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. \n\nWhen the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.\n\nPlayable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.\n",

Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn\u2019t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there\u2019s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.\u201d\n9/10 \u2013 Thunderbolt Games\n\n\u201cIt looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.\u201d\n4/5 \u2013 Touch Arcade\n\n",

Evil possessed his friends, whom he was forced to kill, and his right hand, which he sawed off. For the next thirty years, Ash ran from his past, working at a Value Stop department store and seducing women in dive bars.

        "description": "Ghost Face\u00ae is joining Dead by Daylight. Lurking in the shroud of night, he is a natural stalker who observes his victims before striking. The Ghost Face DLC includes two exclusive items for The Ghost Face: the body Monochrome Maniac and weapon Silvery Steel Tactical Knife. These items are only available as part of the DLC.\n\nAcquaintances are a dangerous deception. The workplace is filled with them; strangers seated beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise. No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.\n\nThe Ghost Face took full advantage of that fact, blending in the everyday. He would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. \n\nBut this time he found a richer hunting ground\u2026\n",
