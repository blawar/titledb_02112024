Interchange between Luigi and Gooigi as one player, or grab a friend and control one each.\n\nFor more frenetic multiplayer action, race the timer to clear various objectives on a series of floors in ScareScraper mode. ScareScraper mode can be played online or locally with up to eight players on four Nintendo Switch systems.\n\nPlease note: paid downloadable content will come to Luigi's Mansion 3 in the future, adding new content to the ScareScraper and ScreamPark multiplayer modes!\n\nAdditional controllers and accessories (sold separately) may be required to play multiplayer on Nintendo Switch Lite.",

Playing as mailman Tim, you must brave the tower and its complex rooms of maddening puzzles, in a bid to reach the top and deliver a peace offering to the Warlock.\n\nClearing each room won\u2019t be easy, though! Every step you take costs a life point, monsters and traps are everywhere, and some rooms require two characters working in tandem to proceed!\n\nDelivering the post has never been so challenging. Watch your step!\n\nFeatures:\n * Solve 100+ increasingly complex rooms\n * Outwit zombies, flying eyes, & slimes. Your ever-diminishing steps are far from the only danger.\n * Feel the 80s! Retro, 8-bit aesthetics make you feel like you're playing your favourite handheld again.",

In the REPLAY MODE+, a player can challenge each area with their own plane and bombs. SCORE ATTACK MODE allows a player to play for the high score with their dif\ufb01culty. Both modes will have an online leaderboard to show how you stack up against other players.\n> DELTA POINT 2 // NEW UI\nThe new UI shows Ex levels, boss health, and invincible time remaining after leveling up. The new design is easy for beginners to understand while the information helps experts as well. In the options menu, a player can show the hit area for their own plane and their enemies so that the game can be adjusted based on the players level of play.\n>DELTA POINT 3 // NEW PLANES\nAlong with the 2 original planes, there will be new planes available as paid DLC which bring all new original attacks. These DLC can be used on all levels allowing players to have a different game play experience.",

Make sure you have enough provision, defend yourself and unravel the mysteries of these lands.\n\nDo not be forgotten\nCrush anyone who dares to attack your lands. Each fallen enemy brings you closer to Asgard! Bones, teeth, fur - use all that you scavenge to craft weapons and armor. Build a fortress that will protect you from enemies and help you to destroy the attackers. The Death Priests will issue ultimatums. Will you bend to their will, or reject their orders and accept the battle against their dead minions?\n\nFind a way out\nCollect all the pieces of the portal to Asgard. But be careful - they are fiercely guarded by mighty giants, deadly spiders and hordes of undead.\n\nCraft\nBrew potions from mushrooms and slain beasts to become stronger. Cook the best dishes to feed all your friends. Prepare poison that will kill the most powerful troll.\n\nExplore ancient caves\nReach the very heart of the world to find powerful artefacts that will help you win the final battle.

Shoot, slash, dash and upgrade yourself to survive the endless waves of deadly traps, homicidal AI and colossal Wardens standing in your way in a stylish alternative version of 1988.\n\nThe world is reeling from a nuclear cataclysm, created by Duncan, the tower architect. The First of his bombs fell in the summer of 1988, and by December they had blacked-out the sun with endless rain. We decided to stop keeping time after this, and it\u2019s been 1988 ever since. Everything that lived through the initial attack will die in the extreme floods that followed.  These are the times after, where there are no more months, or even weeks\u2026everything is measured in minutes left to live. \n\nTake on the mantle of one of the last remaining misfit survivors, and fight your way to the top of the tower to kill the architect and stop the endless nuclear rain. Ascend to die, and die to survive.\n\nDeath Ascendant: Climb an always evolving procedural tower and fight for survival through a constant onslaught of death by fire, lasers, and slashes. \n\nUnique Synth-Punk World: Play through a unique take on a retro cyberpunk dystopia, and fight to survive through 5 distinct zones each with their own challenges.\n\nPick Your Poison: Play as one of 5 playable characters, each with their own unique buffs and weaknesses.\n\nRuin Friendships: Test your wits and reflexes with a friend in couch co-op, and experience a completely unique take on the co-op roguelike.\n\nKill the Wardens: Fight for survival by challenging the numerous unique bosses that guard each one of the game\u2019s zones.\n\nFog Machines and Laser Beams: Bring a gun and laser sword to a fire fight by arming yourself with a selection of the 50 unique weapons available in the game, each with their own unique effects.\n\nEvolve to Survive: The only way to survive when everything, including your own heart, is trying to kill you is to carefully boost or curse yourself by strategically choosing- and combining from 30 distinct buffs and curses.\n\nDailies: Every day, a new challenge is generated with unique attributes that will test your mettle and allow you to see how your skills compare against other players in a global Leaderboard.

This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

        "description": "Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit. In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. \n\nIn the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle it out online!\n\nUp to 4 players:\nPlay locally AND online with up to 4 players.\n\nEasy to pick up, hard to master gameplay:\nStart off simply hitting the ball faster and faster back and forth. Improve by learning how to use Smashes, Bunts and Special Abilities to your advantage. Then go further beyond with parries and countering with throws ending with the pure psychological goodness: taunts. \n\nTons of unlockable extras and secrets:\nUnlock characters and their outfits as you play. New modes and stages are in there too and even the soundtrack can be unlocked to play at leisure. \n\nPlay on your own:\nStep up to the plate by yourself and beat a series of opponents in the Arcade Mode to reach the beat-blasting bossfight. Then check out the event-based Story Mode that has you playing all sides of the going-downs in Shine City.\n\nModes and options:\nPick your preferred style of play like with HP, one-shot kill or points. And then there are game modes like Strikers, using goals, and something called Lethal Volley... \n\nWicked Tracks:\nA Breakbeat, Hip-Hop and House soundtrack featuring the likes of Hideki Naganuma, Frank Klepacki, Pixelord, Bignic and of course Klaus Veen.\n\nLethal League Blaze is the sequel to the popular projectile-fighting game Lethal League known for it's ridiculous speeds and hitstun, the original game was intense to watch and intenser to play. This time around there will be double the characters at launch and more to come after.",

Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!\n\nEverything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia\u2019s self-titled \"Baron\" has devised a plot to mine the world\u2019s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.\n\nThe stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron\u2019s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron\u2019s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia\u2019s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she\u2019s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it\u2019s too late. \n\nOur hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down the Baron\u2019s Digsites before it\u2019s too late...\n\nKey Features\n\u2022\tStunning visuals - Intricate pixel art aesthetic inspired by retro classics\n\u2022\tExplore the world of Sparklite - Five beautiful, procedurally generated biomes\n\u2022\tInvent your arsenal - Invent gadgets to solve puzzles and defeat enemies\n\u2022\tBattle bosses - Take on the Baron Mining Corp and its formidable gremlin Titans\n\u2022\tMeet the locals - Befriend the people of Geodia and help build The Refuge\n\u2022\tHunt collectibles - Discover collectibles scattered throughout the world\n\u2022\tBuddy up! - Rescue Ada\u2019s robotic sidekick to play local assistive co-op with a friend",

Fight scary creatures, rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits, and weapons. Decide where to go next, whether it's upgrading this wrecked car, or rescuing that dog. Just remember, there are consequences for every action. Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Always keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet.\n- Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car before it's too late.\n- Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains, across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character is randomly generated, so each trip is new.\n- Equip dozens of items, including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage racks.\n- A completely new end of the world from Finji (Canabalt, Night in the Woods).",

        "description": "Streets of Rogue is a rogue-lite about player choice, freedom, and anarchic fun. The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of immersive sims and RPGs.\n\nRather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.\n\nIn order to progress, the player will need to accomplish specific mission goals in any way they see fit through the use of their special character traits, items, and the environment.\nWill you play as a soldier who shoots first and asks questions later?\nA stealthy doctor who uses chloroform and tranquilizer darts to take down the opposition?\nOr how about a gorilla, rescuing other caged gorillas to form a small mobilized gorilla army?",

        "description": "Play as Jason Voorhees!\n\nFor the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You\u2019ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!\n\nJason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!\n\nFans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including: \n\uf0a7 Friday the 13th, Part II\n\uf0a7 Friday the 13th, Part III\n\uf0a7 Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives\n\uf0a7 Friday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood\n\uf0a7 Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan\n\uf0a7 Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday\n\nHow Will You Survive? \n\nThe entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. \n\nFriday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!\n\nPlay as the Counselors!\n\nWe all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!",

        "intro": "Ancient civilizations compete to be the first to reach the sky.",
        "description": "Ages ago, the gods contacted several civilizations all around the world. But since then, they remained silent. Now they need to hear our calls.\n\nDivine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.\n\nSix of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they've elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible.\n\nKey Features:\n\n    Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes\n    Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.)\n    Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents\n    Special moves\n    Tile-based isometric 3D graphics\n    Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design\n\nGame mechanics:\n\nThe game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.\n\nThe player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.\n\nEach turn, the player has two move options:\n\n    The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.\n    You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.\n\nSpecial moves:\n\n    If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.\n    If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.\n    If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.\n\nThere are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.\n\nGame modes:\n\nThere are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.\n\n    Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.\n    Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones. The player has a limited amount of moves to build a single temple, whether alone or against opponents in later stages.",

        "description": "Dive into Munchkin: Quacked Quest and re-discover the parody, puns, and humor from the hit card game Munchkin by Steve Jackson. Gather gold, throw your foes (and friends) into sacrifice pits, collect ducks, eliminate the monsters\u2014from reanimated skeletons to the Potted Plant and even the Plutonium Dragon\u2014and reach the highest level to win the game! After all, there\u2019s only one spot at the top and you just found a chainsaw\u2026\n\nSometimes the enemy is next to you on the couch.\n  \nGather your best friends, or enemies (doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019ll turn on each other either way), and take down the rampaging hordes of monsters! Beat your \u201callies\u201d to the treasure and gear up with legendary weapons such as the Rat-on-a-Stick, a Scepter that sends love or a Flare Gun.. Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin: Quacked Quest can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can be the first to grab the ducks.\n\n...HEY, THAT\u2019S MY DUCK! \n\nNot afraid of chickens and trolls? Do you enjoy smashing random objects for loot? Are you eager to vanquish epic bosses and betray your friends? In either the solo or local multiplayer mode, you race through randomly generated dungeons and overcome increasingly bizarre challenges. Choose from four different races and classes and unleash their special skills at the right moment to gain an advantage over your opponents. The mix between accessible, yet rich, gameplay and a leveling race offers intense and skill-based brawling action. \n\n...I SAID DROP THE DUCK, BOB!\n\nTrust the Wight Brothers and their Fabulous Dungeonarium Machine (FDM\u2122\u00a9) to generate unique dungeons filled with deadly traps, dangerous enemies and magnificent ducks. Every adventure will be enhanced by random modifiers. The more victories you claim, the more possibilities will be added to your game.  \n \n\nMain gameplay features:\n\u2022 Play solo or with up to four players in couch mode and adventure through deadly dungeons where enemies lurk. Be careful, sometimes the most dangerous enemy is sitting right next to you\u2026\n\u2022 Be the fastest, the most cunning, or the most effective at accomplishing the crazy objectives of each dungeon: capture ducks, slay monsters, defeat bosses, while throwing your friends/foes into pits and smashing furniture\u2026 everything you wish you could have done at your cousin\u2019s wedding.\n\u2022 Four races and four classes available: become a fashionable Orc Priest, a grumpy Dwarf Wizard, or dozens of other combinations. (Management will deny any liability in case of a botched spell or missing limb.)\n\u2022 More than 20 weapons to wield for hitting, cutting, shooting, hugging, burning, smashing or knocking down more than 15 different enemies\u2014or friends. Just in case, you know...they get in your way. And if you want to hit harder, run faster, or be even more annoying to the other players, there are nine almost-lethal items to choose from. \n\u2022 Randomly generated dungeons for infinite replay value! You will never need to purchase another game. Ever. #MarketingDPTApproves\n\u2022 Customized experience: choose player mode and game duration and let the back-stabbing, loot-grabbing, slaying, and betraying commence!\n\nHA HA! THE DUCK IS MINE! MINE!!!\n",

        "description": "You are Sprocket, an adorable ferret on a remote space station. Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the most stuff!\n\nWidget Satchel is a thrilling adventure for one little thief, with fiendish puzzles, joyous platforming, and dozens of hidden collectables. As you stumble deeper though the station evading your human caretakers, you steal things like widgets and socks. And you stash them, because you\u2019re a ferret.\n\nEvery widget you collect adds to the weight of your satchel, making it a little harder to reach the next platform or avoid the station\u2019s maintenance bots. Stash enough widgets, and you can use them to fabricate doohickeys, which help you unlock new paths and previously out of reach areas. It\u2019s a ferretroidvania!\n\nBut don't worry: You may lose some widgets (or your socks!), but Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no \"game over.\" And nothing is blocking your path to the shuttlebay, so the game is only as challenging as you want it to be.\n\nIt's up to you: race though the station at top speed, or meander around knocking over piles of junk and hitting bots with your wrench. Or\u2026 gather up all your ferret-y determination to stash away each widget, discover every trinket, and try on all 30+ pairs of socks -- including a Nintendo Switch\u2122-exclusive pair of \u201cJoy-Sock\u201d that match your Joy-Con\u2122 colors!\n\nEven after you finish the game, the adventure isn't over. Escape your playpen again (and again) to pursue different challenges. Ferret out all those hard-to-reach areas for a higher widget count, knock around more junk for a greater mischief score, or zoom through the station for a faster finish time.\n\nThe more you play, the more of the game's 20+ unique \u201cfeats\u201d you're likely to accomplish, and the more you\u2019ll discover about the station, its human crew, and the Expedition they\u2019re a part of.\n\nJust remember: Commander Key misses you, and is waiting patiently for you to return to her\u2026",

Build, roll, and slash your way through waves upon waves of goblins, ogres, golems, and more! Upgrade your character as you advance through the story with a plethora of enhancements available within the skill tree. These abilities also apply in co-op mode, so everybody benefits! Be sure to visit the Wardrobe Well and cycle between loads of quirky heads to customize your Duke, unlocking more choices as you progress. Unique towers, potent powers, and 8-bit flowers ensure you'll be back for more. \n\nCO-OP\nAny true hero can call upon trusty companions in their time of need. Explore new strategies when you bring along a friend! Journey forth with a partner from the comfort of your couch, where you both can dash, slice, and build with local co-op multiplayer.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis is an action-based tower defense like no other you've experienced. Slash goblins, ogres, wizards, and more with your sword, roll through waves of enemies, and build towers as fast as you can. Reap the rewards of combat by collecting coins from fallen foes, but tread carefully so as not to get walloped on the field of action! Turn the trees scattering the battlefield into a combination of the nine powerful towers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses against different monsters - so be sure to use your resources wisely! Prepare for fast-paced boss battles with some pretty angsty wizards, conversations with philosophical deer, and hordes of bit-constructed baddies. \n\nSOUNDTRACK\nThe whole experience is wrapped up in an unbelievable composition containing everything from sweat-inducing chiptunes to comedic ambience. Over 30 unique tracks!",

Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.\n\nAs with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island. \n\nNature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",

Pursued by aliens, it\u2019s up to the lowly security droids to save humanity. Taking up arms solo or with a friend, you must dance with death in a brutal and addictive arcade platformer shooter inspired by Super Crate Box and stuffed to the brim with unlockables.\n\nFight through rapid fire single screen levels each with a random combination of platform layout, objective, vending machines and enemies. Dodge and weave amongst the aliens to stay alive but don\u2019t leave them standing too long or the ship\u2019s radiation will mutate them into bigger, nastier versions. \n\nOnly by unlocking and mastering the wild variety of weapons, explosives, special abilities, defense moves and perks can you hope to survive across all three galaxies, rid your ship of the mutant menace and save the oblivious humans.\n\nFeatures\nIntense & Brutal Action\nRapid fire levels give you no rest as hordes of enemies arrive, hell-bent on your destruction. Clear the objective quickly and be sure to kill each enemy before it has the chance to mutate into a bigger, nastier version of itself. Take a tiny breather and then it\u2019s on to the next room.\n\nDance with Death\nIn the tight confines of the space freighter, standing still is not an option. Your ability to dodge around enemies is as important as your aim. Survival requires quick thinking and rapid reflexes and a true master of the dance is a beautiful thing to behold.\n\nDifferent Every Time\nEach single screen level is randomised, drawing on a pool of platform layouts, objective types and enemies as well as which vending machines will be present. You\u2019ll never know which weapons or grenades will spawn in the vending machines whilst crate drops containing special abilities, sidearms, perks and defense moves are also random, adding further to the mind-boggling possible combinations.\n\nOverflowing with Unlockables\nA wealth of weapons, sidearms, special abilities, perks, explosives, defense moves and character skins awaits you. Each new unlockable joins the melting pot of random ingredients, increasing your options but also the need to master each individual element and the way they combine with each other.\n\nPlay Solo or with a Friend\nTake on the mutant hordes by yourself or team up in local co-op. Two player adds further complications to master as you must be careful to avoid friendly fire from explosives and will have to share/fight over item and health pack drops.",

The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year \u2013 both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia.   \n\n\nDesign: a completely new approach with amazing results \n\nEvery picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles. \n\nEach of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. \n     \nWhile the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds. \n\n\nLevels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours \n    \nWith more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay. While some levels can be solved in minutes, other may take hours to finally crack. There is a solution for every single level. \n\nAs a special feature, you can compare your personal results with those of other players that have solved each individual level before you. \n\nOn every single day of the year, four new levels await you to be solved. From (relatively) easy to very difficult, players can expect real challenges. For each solved level, the player is awarded with a calorie-free fortune cookie. More than 700 different messages await discovery! \n\n\nMusic: A relaxing, uplifting soundtrack \nWe\u2019ve listened to hundreds of relaxing Chinese-themed songs for close to a year to create a soundtrack of more than 20 inspiring, unobtrusive tracks. The result is beautiful music that not only helps you concentrate and relax, but also completes the meditative experience of playing Pure Mahjong and stimulates your senses. \n\n\nNatively created for Nintendo Switch\u2122\n\nPure Mahjong and its amazing visuals is without doubt a game for the big screen. Plus, its integrated screensaver will make you never want to switch it off. Our team has spent a lot of time making the gameplay and selection of tiles as easy and native as possible using even one Joy-Con\u2122. However, the handheld mode is no less fun, and the game is a delight to play with the touch screen. \n\n\nBonus: The most beautiful screensaver \n\nOver several months, we\u2019ve collected and licensed hundreds of amazing super high-resolution photographs, covering nature, customs, architecture, food and many other topics that reflect today\u2019s China. The collection really is amazing, and it can be enjoyed by those who connect their Nintendo Switch\u2122 console to their big-screen TV. Our entire team now uses this screensaver with the relaxing soundtrack on their TVs at home. Tip: Disable \"screen burn-in reduction\" in the System Settings - TV settings in your Nintendo Switch\u2122 console to fully enjoy the screensaver.\n",

By constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Flow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black - upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being carried by a flow.\n\n- Fascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden images and optical illusions.\n\n- Design without words. There is almost no text in the game and the story is told through gameplay and visuals.\n\n- Meditative ambient soundtrack by Brokenkites.",

Use the wall run to get the vantage point on your enemies, then assault them with a spinning barrage of bullets using Rain Storm.\n\nReprise your role as Dante, or play as the new femme fatale, Lucia, who prefers deadly throwing daggers to bullets and utilizes her speed with ninja-like reflexes. Build up your Devil Trigger gauge, then transform into a powerful demon with enhanced power and speed. While in demon form, Dante and Lucia can also utilize Devil Hearts - amulets that give them special powers like the ability to fly, super speed or even slowing down time.\n\nDevil May Cry 2 also introduces the unlockable bonus mode, Bloody Palace - where players can earn Red Orbs while trying to clear wave after wave of enemies.",

Intrigued, she takes a job as a delivery person and occasional chef for a local restaurant. Through exploration and conversations with the locals, Kawase gradually learns the history of the town, the mysterious castle that floats above it, the dangerous cavern that lurks below it and the unspeakable demons who have terrorized its residents.\n\nIn Umihara Kawase Fresh!, Kawase carries a fishing lure with \u201crubber-band action.\u201d The lure can be used as a grappling hook to swing from platforms, as a winch to raise or lower herself while suspended, as a bungee cord to slingshot herself in any direction and as a weapon to stun or defeat enemies. Features a large explorable map, more than 75 unique quests, time attack mode, dozens of unique recipes to collect and prepare, more than 50 unique enemies and bosses, unlockable alternate playable characters and more!",

All these elements have a direct impact on the games in the league.\n\nBefore league matches conduct sparing with other teams, to prepare the appropriate tactics. In sparing you can test different combinations of Special Skills, select weapons, behavior and observe their impact on the game.\n\nStart in Sponsored Tournaments to gain experience and earn cash prizes.\n\nTo reach the very top there is hard work and loads of matches to play.\n\nGame features:\n- two game modes (FPS, MOBA)\n- 3 leagues in each match mode\n- 48 different teams in each League\n- 40 special skills for each member of the team\n- 20 special skills for each team\n- 25 weapon types\n- 12 types of heroes in MOBA\n- 9 rooms in the team base with the possibility to expand\n- 142 items of equipment to purchase\n- 69 Sponsored Tournaments\n- unlimited number of advertising contracts ",

Mainlining questions techno-ethics and whether it is acceptable for an organisation to have the power to look at personal data. What if someone else got the key to that?",

        "description": "In the late 1970s, the charismatic Isaac and Rebecca Walker lead the Collective Justice Mission. Labeled radicals and feeling persecuted by the US government, they relocate their followers to the one place they believe they can create a socialist utopia: the jungles of South America. There they build Freedom Town. But relatives left behind in the US become worried: what exactly is going on at this compound in the jungle?\nYou play as Vic, an ex-law enforcement officer who has snuck into Freedom Town to check on their nephew, Alex. Whether you choose stealth or violence, you must infiltrate the commune, find out what\u2019s going on within, and locate your nephew, before it\u2019s too late.\nHow dangerous are the Walkers? How far will you go to uncover the truth and save Alex? Could it all have turned out differently?",

You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\n\nWhen the level starts \u201ctime is frozen\u201d, gravity doesn\u2019t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\n\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\n\nGadgets\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\n\nObjectives\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\n\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become. ",

You take on the role of Miku, a young girl who has brought her wounded brother to the city in their small fishing boat. Navigate the flooded city streets by boat, scale the drowned buildings, and use your telescope to scour the city for the supplies needed to save your dying sibling. As you explore the city at your own pace, you encounter the habitat that flourishes in this colorful place and discover hidden objects that piece together the story of a broken world and a broken family.\n\nGame Features\n\n- Vast outdoor environments with a rich, colorful and vibrant habitat present the player with a beautiful place to linger during the day or night, and encounter the mysterious remnants that watch you from the rooftops.\n\n- A serene and relaxing game experience; take your time to enjoy the sunrise and beautiful vistas, listen to the sound of the ocean, or observe the playfulness of the creatures that inhabit this place. There is only one pace in this game and that\u2019s your own.\n\n- Discover the hidden objects that piece together the story of redemption, sacrifice and determination, and learn more about how the city came to be this way.\n\n- Cruise through the city streets in your small powered fishing boat, using your telescope to identify which of the various buildings contain supplies and mark them on your map.\n\n- Discover the best path to the objects you spotted from afar. Dock your boat at tall buildings and landmarks and climb the vines, ladders, ledges and pipes as increasingly difficult navigation puzzles.\n\n- Developed by an independent studio based in Australia, consisting of AAA veterans who have previously worked on the BioShock series, with music from BAFTA award winning composer Jeff van Dyck.",

        "description": "Life at the convent school isn't easy for Lilli. Only her vivid imagination lets the shy girl escape everyday-drudgery under the stern, watchful eye of the Mother Superior. She diligently works through her chores, no matter how unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any resentment, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable shell of sweetness.\nAnd if anything goes awry or gets ugly, the jolly censorship gnomes got her back: they put a nice coat of pink paint over all the things Lili would rather not consciously confront. But are her little potato-shaped budies real or just a figment of her vivid subconscious? Maybe it's only a matter of time until she completely loses her mind!\nWhen her best friend Edna disappears under mysterious circumstances, Lili bravely sets out on a dangerous journey, not only to get her friend back, but also to confront her subconscious fears.",

A new engrossing wartime narrative and beloved tactical gameplay return as TINY METAL: FULL METAL RUMBLE revisits the core of what made the first franchise entry a beloved and intense, turn-based strategy experience.\n\nTINY METAL: FULL METAL RUMBLE follows a familiar face but new protagonist, the fiercely independent leader of the White Fangs, Commander Wolfram. Search for her brother and stage defenses on multiple fronts against the Dinoldans to stop their excavation of dangerous, ancient technology and restore peace to a land ravaged by the horrors of war.\n\nFULL METAL RUMBLE cranks things up a notch from the original TINY METAL, offering 77 skirmish maps, 21 of which are available for intense multiplayer showdowns.  An expanded army fields more than 21-unit types, with additional Hero and Commander units, to lead into battle across 39 campaign missions. The addition of bonus challenge conditions on every map encourages commanders to fight for goals outside of the main objective. Four new difficulty modes enable veterans and recruits alike to find thrills in the heat of battle\n\nAREA35 has crafted an engaging world with rich history, adding intrigue to every firefight. The writing talent of Hiro Inaba and composing genius of Tomoki Miyoshi bring the characters, world, and action to vibrant life.",

Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.\n\n\u2013 Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return. \n\n\u2013 Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.\n\n\u2013 As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.\n\n\u2013 Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.\n\n\u2013 Complex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.\n\n\u2013 All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!\n\n\u2013 Local Co-op. Complete missions together for better scores and more fun!",

O.Din, has the mission to prevent Lemuz Oki, a.k.a. L.Oki, destroy the world order and create a new realm of chaos to seize the biggest technology company, as well as control the entire world. Tyr, with the help of Huginn & Muninn (\"thought\" and \"memory\") and his faithful Sleipnir, he will take the summit of Valhalla to stop the evil plans of L.Oki and his group of vikings & robots.\n\nIn a nordic cyberpunk universe where the struggle between big corporations destroys the world as we know it, a hero must bring order in this world. In Tyr: Chains of Valhalla you can meet the climax and impetus of the Ragnar\u00f6k seen from a cyberpunk perspective.\n\nTyr: Chains of Valhalla is a 2.5D shooter/platformer full of power-ups, vikings, robots, awesome and difficult bosses. Tyr: Chains of Valhalla combines 3D scenarios and bosses with 2D characters and enemies.\n\nThe time is against you! So be quick, accurate and over all, powerful!

But, every level requires cooperation to complete.\n\n[Battle Mode]\n Co-op play is the main work of this game, but let's compete with friends in BATTLE MODE once co-op play is completed.\n\n[Endless Mode]\n Even if you complete all 48 stages, you can play ENDLESS mode to aim at high score by collaborating with friends.

Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.\n\nThe gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.\n\nUltimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\n\nCreated by Giant Sparrow, the team behind the first-person painting game The Unfinished Swan.",

Uncover the amazing story, untangle the mystery and try to save your loved one.\n \nThis is not an easy task. It\u2019s a huge open world area filled with dangers and anomalies. Hungry predators and sub-human creatures, they all want a piece of you. The elements, combined with radiation and unexplained phenomenon, make the lovely looking environment a place where you shouldn\u2019t be.  Yet, here you are.\n \nScavenge for resources inside any building and especially the landmarks of Pripyat: hotel Polissya, the cultural center, cinema Prometheus, the swimming pool and all the abandoned flat buildings. Craft and choose your gear wisely. Discover and use the campsites for safely passing the nights.  Equipment, weapons and the vehicles you may find and use are your only friends.\n \nGood luck!",

As the sun sets over Atlantic Island Park, you must explore its dilapidated rides in search of your son, Callum. As darkness falls, you will experience panic and paranoia through a narrative written by a team of award winning storytellers. \n\nAmusement parks are happy places, filled with the joys of childhood and the exhilarating rush of fantastic rides to be dared. That was the vision of eccentric business man Nathaniel Winter when he opened the doors to Atlantic Island Park in 1977.\nUnfortunately, the park's history turned out to be one plagued by tragedy and drama. Its freak accidents, grotesque killings and ghostly hauntings have inspired many a sensational headline, and locals worry the park is far from done claiming innocent lives.\nFor Lorraine, it's where her worst nightmare began.\n\n- Explore Atlantic Island Park and step onto rides such as the Ferris Wheel, the Bumper Cars and the Rollercoaster; just beware, some of them have a life of their own.\n\n- Enter the mind of Lorraine, a woman facing every parent's worst nightmare, and unravel her story as well as the dark and tragic history of the park.\n\nNote: This experience deals with subject matter that might prove emotionally distressing to some. Player discretion is advised.",

        "description": "Maddening Euphoria is a unique, challenging arcade game with randomly generated level design, in which you control brother and sister duet Mason and Millicent Zane as they flee from their own imagined realisation of their troubles in life - an inescapable wall of death - while avoiding bottomless pits, deadly spikes and speed-reducing pools of thick goo. Keep within spitting distance of the wall to receive a short, colourful Second Wind speed boost and gain the opportunity to be one eighth euphoric.\n\nNot enough for you? Don your favourite fedora, go for eight pieces, and enter the multicoloured rainbow world of Euphoria where time goes even faster, spikes disappear and your survival speeds up dramatically. Or tackle some of the game's 150+ challenges ranging anywhere from trivially easy to borderline unfathomable.\n\nMeanwhile, choose from 36 game themes (or throw it on Shuffle), each with themed poetry telling tales of your demise with anywhere from innocent whimsy to incomparable filth, and ranging from surprisingly clever to embarrassingly hideous. If you're English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, German, Spanish, Japanese, American, or from Bristol or Norwich, we apologise profusely. Also have the game mock your failures in one of 51 ways of varying levels of Britishness.\n\nThis is the flashiest, fleshiest Maddening to date. It even has some diamondy bits. But you can turn those off if you're only in it for the circles.",

The player who collects all the watermelons first is the winner. The others are ranked by their speed and number of watermelons remaining.\n\nThe game is family friendly: Each player can set their own difficulty. Kids and less experienced players have an even playing field versus puzzle geniuses.\n\nThe game supports tabletop mode, so two players can play with one pair of Joy-Con\u2122 controllers.\n",

By slashing hordes of shadow monsters in the past, Warlocks have angered the Gods, who now turned against them. In result, you can now either give up, ask for mercy and then quietly die, as \u201cmercy\u201d is not a word easily found in Dark Gods\u2019 vocabulary. \u00a0Or you could release all your godlike powers instead and make the Gods pay for their betrayal.\n\nBe sure though, that they\u2019re not willing to go without a fight and they\u2019ll throw at you all kinds of seemingly hilarious pixel art opponents. Don't be fooled by their funny looks however as rest assured, they\u2019ll use any means necessary including their special skill sets to take you down. With the aid of giant bosses they will bring your skills to the test. Slay or get slain. There\u2019s no other way.\n\nIn Warlocks 2: God Slayers you\u2019ll find:\n\u25cf Hilarious pixel art with hand-drawn animations;\n\u25cf Dynamic hack'n\u2019slash experience in solo and local co-op;\n\u25cf More than 40 types of challenging enemies that work together to take you down, using their unique skill sets;\n\u25cf Extensive maps with tons of randomly generated loot to be picked up;\n\u25cf 5 different types of Warlocks to pick up from, each with their own abilities to unlock throughout the game;\n\u25cf 8-10 hours of gameplay to complete the adventure with one Warlock\n\u25cf Varied powerful and enormous bosses only waiting to get slain.",

But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\n\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\n\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\n\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\n\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\n\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\n\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\n\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\n\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\n\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\n\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\n\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\n\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\n\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?",

A massive amount of lovingly-made environments, maps, modes, and abilities \u2013 all obsessively balanced \u2013 combine for high replayability and a deep path to mastery.\n\n\u2605 Single Player Campaigns\nChallenge yourself in the Hero\u2019s Journey: individually tailored hero campaigns filled with puzzle rooms, skill challenges, and boss fights. The unique abilities have entire journeys built specifically to teach you to properly use that hero\u2019s playstyle \u2013 all while the art of stealth and mastery of movement becomes second-nature.\n\n\u2605 Multiplayer Battles - Local and Online\nOnce you\u2019ve honed your skills in the Hero\u2019s Journey and defeated all of your friends, you\u2019ll want to challenge the world! Online matchmaking, crossplay with the PC community, and public or private matches with join keys allow you to find a foe anytime, anywhere.\n\n\u2605 Choose your Main\nWith 12 different heroes \u2013 each with their own unique ability \u2013 there is a perfect strategy for every playstyle. From meticulously sneaky to ruthlessly aggressive, find your favorite ability and shock your friends when you appear out of thin air and surprise them!\n\n\u2605 Competitive, Deep Hide and Seek\nCount your steps to find the perfect hiding spot, wait for your foes to reveal themselves, then pounce! While counterintuitive at first, invisibility becomes your most versatile tool, leading to intense moments of complete silence. Invisigun\u2019s core mechanics reward patience, forethought, trickery, and awareness.\n\n\u2605 Easy to Learn, Tough to Master\nThe depth is nearly unlimited with intentional baits, undetectable direction changes, powerup drops, and accidental bumps (that may not be so accidental). The chess dance is infinite and evolving, and all of the deceit is only heightened by the fact that your opponents could be lurking ANYWHERE!",

Adventuring, exploring ruins, accidentally unleashing the apocalypse, saving the world\u2026 you\u2019ve done it all, and so has Argus. And, frankly, he\u2019s a bit fed up with the whole thing. He used to be a wizard, which was fine and all, but he\u2019s in his 30s now, and he wants to settle down, get some peace and quiet. But that\u2019s not easy to get with all those spike-haired buffoons dragging their giant swords around and ruining the pavement. Specially when you\u2019re trying to keep a dangerous artifact hidden from meddling heroes with a chosen one complex.\n\n-Explore a world of possibilities in a fully-realized fantasy realm. And one of those world map things we used to love.\n\n-Face huge bosses, dangerous foes, and angsty teenagers.\n\n-Find tons of parodies and pop culture references. Let's see if you can recognise them all.\n\n-Save the world. Sorta. Granted, it's a bit of a clich\u00e9. But hey, it works.\n\n-Unlock special abilities and upgrade basic combo movements with an all-powerful \u201cfinal blow\u201d-type move.\n\n-Evade the cruel and overrated real world with a long single player campaign. \n\n-Well, not as long as that one with the guy with the white hair, SURE, but we're an indie studio, dammit!",

        "description": "A stack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each side - green to approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?\n\nAfter work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech? \n\nOn the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs. \n\nBut every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash? \n\nAfter good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.

        "description": "After abandoning her high-powered tech career and a mysterious three-year absence, Evelyn Ishino-Aubrey resurfaces working as a proxy for a virtual counseling app called Eliza. Her job consists solely of reading a script provided to her in real-time by an AI, leaving her no autonomy over what she says. Is Eliza a technological marvel that brings therapy to those who otherwise couldn\u2019t access it? Or is it an ineffective replacement and another vector for technology companies to gain control over our lives and humanity?\n\nAs she reconnects with people from her past and gets to know the ordinary people of Seattle who use Eliza for counseling, Evelyn finds herself caught in the middle between differing sides of the argument\u2014 and as she begins to question everything about her past life and future purpose in the world, it becomes clear she must confront the turmoil and darkness inside.\n\n\u2022 A thought-provoking story told in the form of a visual novel from an award-winning indie team.\n\n\u2022 Follow Evelyn\u2019s journey through a present-day Seattle brought to life with beautiful hand-painted art.\n\n\u2022 Get to know Eliza\u2019s clients and the employees of Skandha, the technology giant behind it, with over a dozen fully-voiced characters and powerful performances from a highly regarded cast.\n\n\u2022 An evocative, ambient original score by the composer for Infinifactory, SHENZHEN I/O, Opus Magnum, and EXAPUNKS.\n\n\u2022 Is AI-driven counseling better than nothing? Is it worse than nothing? What responsibilities come with technical skills? Consider your own answers to these questions and more.\n\n\u2022 Counseling sessions getting a little too real? Relax with Kabufuda Solitaire, a new take on solitaire using Japanese kabufuda cards.",

No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\n\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT\u2019s polished, minimalist visual language helps you focus on what's most important \u2013 the fluid gameplay and the cinematic beauty of the fight.\n\nSUPERHOT features:\n\u2022 Endless Mode \u2013 how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?\n\u2022 Challenge Mode \u2013 take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.\n\u2022 Extras \u2013 delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].\n\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.",

The Lings, your workers, will obey you and help you with your village. But beware, they can cause a lot of problems too. If this is not enough, there are other creatures that will try to do the same, they can trade, fight or help you. Oh, don't forget about the weather and some unexpected events.\n\nVILLAGE BUILDING\n\nBuild your own village with many types of buildings, you need to decide what kind of objects, items or workbench you want inside. There are more than 150 items to craft. Every item and object has a reason. For example, craft a Wood Cabinet and put it inside the houses to increase your storage space. Roads can make them walk faster... and more.\n\nYOUR WORKERS\n\nThe Lings works for you. You need to provide basic salary, food, clothes and a \"\"healthy\"\" environment. It's up to you to decide how they work and where. Beware, they can start conflicts with each other and even set your village on fire. Watch them talk and keep your eyes open for their stats. Each one has unique traits and also attributes that you can control.\n\nDISCOVER\n\nSandbox maps with random generated nature based on your initial profile. Custom maps that you can build yourself. Talk, trade or fight with other races. Collect treasures and sell it or use it on your community. Random events that can turn your whole village into a nightmare from day to night. See how weather impacts your food and workers.\n\nAND MORE!\n\nRain and snow will change not only the visuals, but how you will handle your village. Craft better clothes or they can get sick. Craft better weapons and armors to face evil creatures or random thieves. Accept contracts and make enough Surplus (our currency) to make your community bigger. And, if everything goes wrong (or bad for you), you can just sell the village!\n\nWELCOME TO COMMUNITY INC!",

Problem is, the path is broken in several places!\nTo ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged.\n\nSeems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required!\n\nYou just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive.\n\nBear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nFEATURES:\n\u2013 the game was developed specifically with Nintendo Switch\u2122 in mind\n\u2013 it mixes puzzle and arcade game mechanics\n\u2013 the game requires strategic planning, precision, and quick reflexes\n\u2013 comfortable controls using the accelerometer\n\u2013 dynamic score\n\u2013 beautiful graphics, dynamic lights and special effects\n\u2013 over 50 levels",

But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that they harbor animosities and deep hidden motives. The more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations on it, the more complicated and unclear the matter becomes. A seemingly routine case turns into a tale of machinations driven by greed and a suicide investigation reveals multiple murders.\nIs anyone innocent?

The security system has been hacked. All exits are locked. But that is not the real problem.\nSomeone\u2026 something is following you. Red eyes shine from dark corners and the sound of shifting, clanking metal echoes through the once safe halls.. You know them simply as animatronics, but something unknown and horrifying is driving them.

        "description": "Call of Cthulhu, the official videogame inspired by Chaosium's classic pen and paper RPG, brings you deep into a world of creeping madness and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe. \n\n1924. Private Investigator Pierce is sent to look into the tragic death of the Hawkins family on the isolated Darkwater Island. Soon enough, Pierce is pulled into a terrifying world of conspiracies, cultists, and cosmic horrors. Nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and sinister cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything.\n \nYour mind will suffer - between sanity and psychosis, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one. Slinking shadows hide lurking figures\u2026 and all the while, the Great Dreamer prepares for his awakening.",

        "description": "Get some milk, kill the traitors, save Hell and rescue the hottest demoness from the clutches of those nasty people and mega-corporations!\n\nBig Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food caf\u00e9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging.\n\nThe player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.\n\nEver wondered what it's like to be Satan's son? Nothing special... Unleashed lust, chronic alcoholism and reckless shooting - the usual routine\nSave Hell! Wait... What? Yup, that's right - Hell! It's not the place it used to be - Hell's been possessed. Possessed by the most vile dark hideous evil the world has known - people. They've turned your precious homeland into a madhouse, and only you can stop them! What's in it for you? Spectacular locations, battles with epic bosses and a nice mixture of pain and nonsense.\n\nChoose the right side of evil and rescue your \"princess\" - the most badass dare-deviless Hell has ever seen.\n\nThe game contains graphic violence, blood and gore.",

        "description": "Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind Games.\n\nPsychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton\u2019s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary\u2019s true intentions, the dread begins.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nRemothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.\n\n- Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action, strategic, hide \u2018n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and his path. Don\u2019t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.\n\n- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.\n\n- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.\nAudio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.\n\n- No health bars - Your body is the only way to understand how you are doing.\n\n- Realistic puzzles - Environments and characters have been conceived to be realistic and credible.\n\n- Top-notch soundtrack - Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni wrote the music for the game.\n\n- Real-time loading - Explore the mansion without worrying about empty moments or boring loading times.\n\nIn addition, the Nintendo Switch\u2122 version of the game presents these extra features:\n\n- A free integrated Artbook that players will unlock the first time they finish the game. This Artbook will contain the characters, locations and storyboard sequences\u2019 concept art, collected items during the game, wireframes and 3D models of the mansion and characters.\n\n- Controller\u2019s vibration.\n\n- Spatialized audio.",

You cannot play till death. If you die, not only do you wipe your current score, you risk the chance of wiping your leaderboard position as well. How you ask? The lower your health the higher the bonus the greater the risk. Every time you extract your score is marked. Why you ask? Why not?\n\nSPLIT SCREEN SINGLE PLAYER TWIN STICK RISK \u2018EM UP - You will be controlling two ships simultaneously. The devil is in the details. The left side is invincible, however shooting and moving consumes your LINK. In order to restore it you must recover MATERIAL on the right side. MATERIAL multiplies your overall score so use it with absolute discretion. On the right side you are recovering resources and will need 12 PARTS to extract and mark your leaderboard position. Don\u2019t doubt yourself. Push yourself. You will be rewarded and you will be tested.\n\nTEARS - Each Tear consists of new challenges with hella bonuses attached to them. Focus, overcome, and survive.\n\nIf you want a challenge you came to the right place. Don\u2019t doubt what you are capable of. Get out of your comfort zone. Question everything.\n\nArcade Is Not Dead.",

You will have to build and manage cities, provide resources for your inhabitants while making sure there are enough workers to sustain your production lines. Trade with others cities, honor the requests of the Emperor and make your citizens happy.\n\nHistory:\nWith the discovery of condensed steam as a source of energy, the world of Lethis sees an unprecedented Industrial Revolution. As a result, the Empire enters a period of urbanisation. New cities are built everywhere. This rural exodus leads to new towns in strategical places to ensure the growth of the Empire. A time of great change is also a right time for new discoveries and innovation in science. Cities are built around great monuments like gigantic zeppelin hangars and observatories.\"\n\nFeatures:\nA campaign mode containing 26 missions with 3 difficulty levels\nA sandbox mode for unlimited fun\nOver 24 different resources to manage\nMore than 40 different buildings and 4 unique Monuments\nOver fifteen different characters that roam the city\nMaps that reach up to 300 per 300 box tiles\nAn amazing soundtrack with over 20 different songs\n\nThis Nintendo Switch\u2122 version includes new features such as gamepad controls (and partly touch screen), new user interface to perfectly fit the Nintendo Switch\u2122 screen and a smoother difficulty curve!",

At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout.\n\nIt's a dreamy, ethereal, and thoughtfully crafted experience about nostalgia. The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. \n\nWhen the game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.\n\nPlayable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.\n",

Humans, upon making this incredible discovery, have set up outposts along the border of the aggressive plants' habitat for investigations, defense, and in preparation for what may come. You take the role of a soldier on the front lines charged with confronting this strange new enemy.\n\nThe Order of Things... Disrupted\n\"Many years in the future, humanity looks upward in despair at plants, now standing atop the food chain. How could they have been so arrogant...\"\nOnly when plants began sprouting arms and legs and developing self-awareness did humanity truly begin to understand the menace that these once photosynthesis-dependent creatures posed. No one could understand how the plants took this large evolutionary leap in such a short time, something that took their animal counterparts millions of years to accomplish. One thing is certain, now is the time for humanity to make their stand in order to stay at the top of the food chain.\n\nGameplay\nAs one of the first explorers of the newly discovered plant empire, you must continuously drive deeper and deeper into the enemy's lair. Defeat bizarre and colorful fruits while retrieving new gear, weapons, and resources to defend yourself and expand your base camp.\nIf you're unable to defeat the overwhelming destructive force of the plant army alone, invite a few friends to lend a hand and help you discover the secrets behind this strange new world.\n\nGame Features\n- Rougelike elements with random zones, treasures, and monsters\n- Loads of special weapons and items\n- Unique and incredibly detailed art style\n- Expand your camp and unlock new features\n- Solo campaign and local multiplayer",

Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn\u2019t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there\u2019s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.\u201d\n9/10 \u2013 Thunderbolt Games\n\n\u201cIt looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.\u201d\n4/5 \u2013 Touch Arcade\n\n",

        "description": "REALISTIC SIMULATOR \n There are no roads, no paths - only tracks of those who ventured before you. Cars breakdown, fuel is limited and your supplies, scarce. Getting lost is normal and you need to tread your way carefully - yet swiftly. Night limits your vision and sense of direction. Cars get stuck in the mud if you rush without thinking, making you have to use your car\u2019s winch to get out. Crossing rivers and ponds is a gamble you may not win. Rain, snow, fog and blizzard - further increases the difficulty. Should you drive in a straight line through uncertain terrain and risk your car, Or go around and burn more fuel and supplies? It's -ALL- up to you, your skills and guts. \n \nTRUE OFF-ROAD \n No rules, no barriers, no \u2018safe-zones\u2019. Only you, your car and the map - against the odds of the wild and uncharted Alaska. The final challenge and ultimate test. Man versus Nature, in all it\u2019s glory and unrelenting force. Are you in for the ride\u2026? =) \n\nFEATURES\n\u2611 6 unique cars. \n\u2611 2 HUGE, handcrafted and unique maps. \n\u2611 8 different tracks. \n\u2611 2 game modes - \"Career\" and \"Freeride\". \n\u2611 Dynamic Weather that affects your car. \n\u2611 Car Damage System (with visuals). \n\u2611 Day and Night Cycles. \n\u2611 Realistic physics. \n\u2611 Full Control of all the specs of your ride.

        "description": "DRAW CHILLY is a hell of an arcade game where you take on the role of Vladimir and raise a city from the depths of Purgatory at the request of your employers, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\n\nVladimir and his squad of brave, pure-hearted, yet occasionally hapless mechanics fight monkeys as they make their way upwards stage by stage to deliver the bosses, who have ended up in Purgatory by mistake, into the hands of the Reapers so they can be sent to Hell where they belong.\n\nAs you upgrade the city and help Vladimir and his squad grow stronger, you'll learn the backstories of each of your main enemies, see scenes from Vladimir's past, and meet the Four Horsemen, who are kind and have a sense of humor in this universe.\n\nThis 2D pixel arcade game lets you run left and right as much as your little heart pleases, but that's not all! It has other, more important features as well.\n\n- Collect chickens and produce energy using a special, non-violent method to upgrade the city and unlock abilities. The city gives you NPC assistants and squad members, and abilities let Vladimir take down opponents in increasingly showy ways, like summoning a pink worm to slow your enemies then using a giant wrench to deal a devastating blow.\n- Each stage you complete earns you VladCoins, which you can spend to upgrade Vladimir's skills and abilities, making him stronger.\n- Gigantic chickens with crates will grant you new abilities - the faster you catch up to them by raising the city up the endless well the action happens in, the more you get.\n- You can summon the Horsemen of the Apocalypse to help you in battle once the Magnet is fully charged, and they also grant you the Horsemen's Gifts, which are special boss-related bonuses.",

The Ghost Face DLC includes two exclusive items for The Ghost Face: the body Monochrome Maniac and weapon Silvery Steel Tactical Knife. These items are only available as part of the DLC.\n\nAcquaintances are a dangerous deception. The workplace is filled with them; strangers seated beside us, five days a week. A distant familiarity grown from habit; the blanks filled with assumptions as we forget how little we know, until proven otherwise. No one thought the man seated on their left could be responsible for the murder of a dozen people. Until proven otherwise.\n\nThe Ghost Face took full advantage of that fact, blending in the everyday. He would have gotten away with it as he had before: he would have packed his bags when the investigation pointed in his direction, driven a few miles, and looked for another job. \n\nBut this time he found a richer hunting ground\u2026\n",
