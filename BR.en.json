Secret areas exist in the world of GoNNER, and these areas will get you different items that you can then always use from the beginning of each run. We're not going to tell you how you get to these areas or what the criteria is for even finding them because secrets, duh.\n\nMUSIC! It's really freaking good.\n\nGood luck.",

        "intro": "A new challenger has appeared \nin the platform fighter arena!",
        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale. \n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre\u2019s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you\u2019re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout.\nThere are currently six original characters and four popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles:\n-\tDead Cells\n-\tYooka-Laylee\n-\tGuacamelee\n-\tHyper Light Drifter\nAs well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout\u2019s cast numbers 25 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that\u2019s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.\n\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you\u2019d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either Timed, Stock, Team Battles, FFA or Party Modes:\n-\tAll on the same device\n-\tEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby\n-\tOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players\nAI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers and the all new Trials mode.",

Sharpen your knives and dust off your chef\u2019s whites, there isn\u2019t mushroom for error and the steaks are high in these crazy kitchens!\n\nOn the Nintendo Switch\u2122, you can now experience the crazy couch co-operative action of Overcooked wherever you choose. Simply remove the Nintendo Switch console from the Nintendo Switch Dock\u2122 to take your culinary adventures on the road, just like our plucky chefs travelling around the Onion Kingdom!\n\nThe Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.\n\nOvercooked Special Edition features all the exhilarating (and enraging) kitchens from the main game, as well as both expansions, \u2018The Lost Morsel\u2019 and \u2018Festive Seasoning\u2019.\n\nA CULINARY QUEST\nThe Onion Kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual kitchens for you to conquer. Take part in an epic journey and tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens which will push your skills of co-operation and \nco-ordination to the very limits. Each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs.\n\nSIMPLE CONTROLS/DEEP CHALLENGE\nOvercooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a\nwell-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!\n\nWith Nintendo Switch HD Rumble, become immersed in the crazy culinary antics like never before.\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY\nWhether indulging in deep fried local co-op or saut\u00e9ed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.\n\nJust like cooking itself, Overcooked is best enjoyed with friends! Call in backup from a buddy by detaching the Joy-Con\u2122 controllers and get to work! Add in an extra set of Joy-Con controllers or two Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers\u2122 and you can play with up to four players for even more frantic fun.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!\n",

Start as a little organism and transform into a magnificent aquatic being. Explore the abyss in search of nutritional elements. Attack other species whenever you run out of other food sources. Enjoy beautiful surreal visuals and relax with minimalistic ambient soundtrack.\n\nCan you grow the biggest Sparkle in the world?\n\nSubtle, captivating, addictive. These three words describe the world of Sparkle - world in which you make a tiny aquatic creature evolve into becoming a grown, magnificent being.\n\nWe give you control over your Sparkle's development and wellbeing, and you have one goal - to evolve. Whilst exploring the Sparkle Void, you find various nutritious elements to eat. Sometimes you will even have to fight for food with other species. You become what you eat - you get to choose whether your sparkle becomes a fast and aggressive carnivore, a sluggish but fast-eating herbivore, or an omnivore, whose features lie somewhere in between. Insight to your Sparkle's DNA strand will give you information about the progress and will help you plan which microelements you want to focus on eating next. You will also get to fight giant bosses from time to time.\n\nBut there\u2019s no rush to keep the game in full swing at all times. You may as well just relax, play the game on a slow pace, explore the sparkle void, consume nutritional elements, enjoy simple and surreal surrounding and listen to the ambient music soundtrack. The choice is all yours.",

        "description": "Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying to figure out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and seemingly cursed Island. Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a demanding, visceral and cathartic action game. \n\nExperience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you\u2019ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.\n\nExploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air...",

Along the way, players can uncover artifacts and stories from the son's life as he becomes intertwined in the fox\u2019s journey towards The First Tree.\n\nFeatures:\n\u25cf Not a \"fox simulator,\" but an emotional, intimate story by a one-man team with an ending you won't soon forget.\n\u25cf Featuring a gorgeous, orchestral soundtrack by acclaimed artists like Message to Bears, Lowercase Noises, and Josh Kramer.\n\u25cf A short story-driven game (about 2 hours long) with some light puzzle solving, platforming, and no enemies.",

An HD remaster of the original game, LUMINES REMASTERED beautifully marries the elements of sound, light and puzzle-action into one addictive, yet easy-to-play game. \n\nYou\u2019re at the center of the high-energy, block-dropping action while you groove to awesome house, trance and techno beats! Play LUMINES REMASTERED on-the-go in Handheld mode or at home in TV and Tabletop modes. \n\nFeel the sound: Play over 40 skins with electronic atmospheres from chill to upbeat. Shuffle skins (like a music playlist) as more are unlocked in a new Shuffle mode.\n\nFeel the challenge: Faster tempos means less time to make combos, but slower songs can mean uncleared stacks. You\u2019ll get hooked.\n\nFeel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.\n\nFeel the vibration: Turn on Trance Vibration and sync multiple Joy-Con\u2122 controllers to feel the bass across your body.",

Will you construct a bustling city that lives and breathes at night, or succumb to the perils and misadventures of the dark hours? \n\nSnowfall: The difficulty heats up when the city cools down, thanks to this expansion\u2019s added challenges and assets, like snow maps, streetcars, and heating systems.

        "description": "Graveyard Keeper is the most inaccurate medieval cemetery management sim of the year. Build & manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",

        "description": "Children of Morta sets its story in a distant land but copes with themes closer to our daily lives that one would expect. It is a story of simple emotions we all know so well and value more than sometimes we dare to admit: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for.\n\nEmbark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe. It\u2019s a story about a valiant family standing together while the world around them is being devoured by darkness.\n\nFEATURES:\n- rogue-lite with a strong storyline\n- 7 playable characters\n- local co-op - play as two Bergsons together against the Corruption! Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future)\n- emotional tale focused on a family of heroes\n- a diverse set of skills\n- passive and active items modifying each run\n- multiple dungeons set in different biomes\n- a rich world full of history and magic\n- Family Trials - a mode separate from the Main Story campaign, offering new systems, items, objectives, character builds, and more - all set in a series of completely randomized dungeons.\n",

        "intro": "How will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?",
        "description": "Just Die Already is an old people mayhem sandbox game created by the designers of Goat Simulator.\n\nYou are an old retired person in a near future where people aren\u2019t having any children. There isn\u2019t anyone to pay for pensions due to those ungrateful millennials who prefer playing video games instead of doing actual work. With no one to cover your living costs, you - just like all other old people in this world - have no other choice but to survive on your own. \nHow will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?\n\nTo make things worse, you\u2019ve just been kicked out of your retirement home, and your only option now is to perform dangerous challenges and explore the world for retirement tickets to qualify for free retirement care. \nSo with society wishing you dead, isn\u2019t it finally time to live a little?\n\nFREE POST-LAUNCH PVP MODES \u2013 AVAILABLE NOW\n\nGive the boomers what they deserve by having them fight for their lives! Compete against your other old friends with this new free Player Versus Player update.\nPlay in 4 new arenas, customize your game modes and start ripping each other\u2019s limbs off. \nBrace yourself up to your nipples in your old man pants, this Old Vs Old mayhem competition is ON!\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nBE OLD, BE BOLD\nYou get to be an old person. Angry, fragile, poor and hating the world: the dream you didn\u2019t know you had until now. Finally, you have found something in common with your grandparents.\n\nBREAK A LEG... BREAK A NECK\nDiscover the joys of being old and made of glass, anything can break you and you can break your everything. \n\nDON\u2019T TRY THIS AT (RETIREMENT) HOME\nComplete dangerous challenges that you will never ever try at home and answer existential questions like: can you launch yourself from a catapult and land on someone? Or, can you survive losing your head, grabbing it and whacking someone with it?\n\nONE MISSION: RETIRE!\nEarn rewards by completing dangerous challenges, your goal? To qualify for a proper retirement home. That makes perfect sense. Word of advice: try and stay in one piece so you can enjoy it in the end\u2026\n\nSANDBOX MULTIPLAYER\nPlay alone, or with up to 4 players in online multiplayer. Complete challenges together, or just cause mayhem and rip your friends\u2019 limbs off! \n\nBE OLD. TWICE.\nYou get to be an old person. So good we said it twice.\n\nLIMITLESS INTERACTION\nPick up and interact with a very wide variety of objects. Everything from giant trouts, trampolines, guns, electrical wiring, and fireworks, just to mention a few. Bazookas, axes, trombones, air horns and jetpacks to mention a few more. Yes they all can be used to hurt and maim.\n\nEMBRACE YOUR INNER BOOMER\nWreak havoc on the millennial and zoomer population (we forgot Generation X, just like everyone else). NPCs react differently depending on their age - some will laugh and clap at others getting hurt while others will run away in terror. \n\nTHE GAME CAN BE AS CRAZY AS YOU\nThe city is filled with detailed environments, loaded with secrets and hidden paths, that encourage detailed exploration and quirky experimentation to truly see it all.\n\nOLD. PERSON.\nOkay that\u2019s the last time we promise.",

        "description": "Winner of Best Game at the 2018 BAFTA Game Awards, as well as Best Narrative awards at the GDC 2018 Choice Awards, 2018 SXSW Gaming Awards, and The Game Awards 2017, What Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange tales about a family in Washington state.\n\nAs Edith, you\u2019ll explore the colossal Finch house, searching for stories as she explores her family history and tries to figure out why she's the last one in her family left alive. Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.\n\nThe gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.\n\nUltimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\n\nCreated by Giant Sparrow, the team behind the first-person painting game The Unfinished Swan.",

In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn\u2019t shout \u201cOBJECTION!\u201d when you know you\u2019ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution\u2019s claims and prove your client\u2019s innocence.\n\nThe game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease!

        "intro": "The Outer Worlds is a new single-player sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division.",
        "description": "Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features:\n\u2022\tThe player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\n\u2022\tYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon. \n\n\u2022\tLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\n\u2022\tExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony\u2019s two planets didn\u2019t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon. \n",

        "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\n\nDive Into a Vast Underwater World\n\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\n\nScavenge, Craft, and Survive\n\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear, and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\n\nConstruct Underwater Habitats\n\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\n\nUnravel the Mystery\n\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\n\nDisrupt the Food Chain\n\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\n\nHandle the Pressure\n\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\n\nFear the Night\n\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\n\nDive Below the Ocean Floor\n\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.",

It is a new chapter in the Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds.\n\nReturn to planet 4546B\n\nSubmerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to investigate what happened to your sister...\n\nUncover the Truth\n\nAlterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and databanks scattered among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own.\n\nDiscover Uncharted Biomes\n\nSwim beneath the blue-lit, arching expanses of Twisty Bridges. Become mesmerized by the glittering, mammoth crystals of the Crystal Caverns. Clamber up snow covered peaks and venture into the icy caves of Glacial Basin. Maneuver between erupting Thermal Vents to discover ancient alien artifacts. Below Zero presents entirely new environments for you to survive, study, and explore.\n\nConstruct Habitats and Vehicles\n\nSurvive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast across the snowy tundra on a Snowfox hoverbike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Seatruck.\n\nResearch Alien Lifeforms\n\nSomething undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Holefish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan, and visit the adorable Pengwings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.\n\nSurvive the Chilly Temperatures\n\nJump in, the water\u2019s warm. The below zero temperatures of this arctic region pose a new threat. New weather conditions blanket above-ground habitats. Craft a toasty cold suit, sip on piping hot coffee, and warm up next to Thermal Lilies to stave off the chill. \n\nAn ocean of intrigue\n\nWhat really happened to your sister? Who were the aliens who came here before? Why were they on this planet? Can we find solace from grief in truth? Below Zero extends the story of the Subnautica universe, diving deep into the mystery introduced in the original game.",

Does this game ever end?!\n \nGhoul Patrol\nZeke and Julie, our intrepid teenagers, visit the Ghosts and Ghouls exhibit at the city library, where they find an old treasure chest containing an ancient spirit book. Naturally, they cannot resist reading it. Suddenly, a horrific snaggle-toothed spirit emerges.\n\nNow, this snarling phantom and his dastardly minions are infesting Metropolis and slithering their way into the history books, where they plan to rewrite history with their spooky ways. Only you have the power to go back in time to de-spook an encyclopedia of zombified historic dudes.\n\nTerminate, with prejudice, using crossbows, ping-pong ball machine guns, Martian \"Heatseeker\" guns, and more.\n\nVaporize garbage can ghosts and ninja spirits, rescue bug-eyed librarians and wigged-out pirates, dodge flying books and adolescent-eating plants!\n\nOnly our two heroes have the power to get the mighty beastly spirit back into his book and stop the madness.

The Guild has never admitted banlits because of their lack of magical capacity; and they've never admitted women because they believed women were too weak-minded to control such power.\n\nNow, many generations later, the elam magic is weakening, and latent magic talent has reappeared among the banlit population. Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.\n\nIn your quest you'll explore randomly generated dungeons, collect treasures, master magic, avoid traps, solve puzzles, and of course cleanse the dungeons of all the evil minions within. Every dungeon is unique, no two locations will ever be the same.\n\nIt's not all dungeon-crawl. Feel at home in your very own Wizard Tower where you can enhance and customize the way you play by building a thriving town, brewing your own reagents, crafting or buying your own gear, powering up your magic, and recruiting help.",

Deeper challenges, deeper sense of achievement!\n\nHow do these puzzle elements work?\nEach fight has been designed as a puzzle that requires a new tactic.

Failing and retrying is part of the game! Fights can be restarted instantly and without any penalty.\n\nTarget audience:\nFlowing Lights was designed to be easy to learn and difficult to master. It's a game for players who like a challenge. Each fight can be won with 4 levels of achievement: C, B, A and S. Ranks A and S can only be achieved by completing all Combos, which adds new challenges for the best players. However, the game is easily accessible with playable tutorials and training modes.\n\nFeatures:\n-Puzzle elements for a varied, always fresh experience\n-Retro Arcade gameplay: smooth, accurate, challenging\n-Unique physics based gameplay, gravity is the true 3rd dimension\n-200 fights created with love, each one unique and with optional challenges\n-Power Ups, Combos, Ranks and online leaderboards for more replayability",

A massive Rogue Star has formed from the cosmos and is on a direct collision path with us! It threatens to vaporize everything. Leaders from planets around the galaxy have assembled a top team of fighters to stop the Rogue Star at all costs. Choose your own non-linear path through the galaxy and explore each of the 10+ planets carefully.\n\nYour Choices, Your Ending. Choose which planets to travel to and make important decisions that decide the fate of the galaxy! Depending on the path you take, there are dozens of different outcomes. The Rogue Star can destroy the entire galaxy, be reflected to the enemy's galaxy, swallowed by a black hole, sent far away through a galactic wormhole, and dozens of other hilarious possibilities in between. It's really up to you to make the right decisions based on the outcome you want to see, and who you want to rescue.\n\nTraps and Defense. While exploring each planet you must gather traps and resources to face an epic mini-boss and his waves of minions at the end of each level. Strategically placed traps slow, block, push, spike, burn, freeze, and shoot at enemies. Traps can be upgraded to make themselves stronger. Managing trap inventory and usage intelligently is critical to your success in the game, especially during the later levels.\n\nHeroes. Choose from one of the elite team members with a unique set of special abilities, each with a personal drive to save their home planet from annihilation. Unlock new players by achieving specific outcomes.\n\nLevel Up! Unlike traditional roguelikes, we've added a persistent leveling up system. With each level you earn attribute points that can improve strength, speed, health, traps, and luck. The more you fight, the more experience points you earn, the stronger you get. Build your player wisely.\n\nGuns and Items. Discover and unlock hundreds of unique items! We're thrilled to present a wide variety of guns from advanced space weaponry, to historical weapons, and everything in between. On top of carrying your main gun, you'll have an arsenal of powerful grenades ready at the tap of a button. You'll also be accompanied by upgradeable buddies, each with their own unique fighting abilities (Did you know there are dragons in space?).\n\nThree modes of difficulty. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned dungeon explorer, we've got you covered! Choose Wimpy, Normal, or Insane mode to challenge your skills and to keep the fun going. Note for the avid bullet-hell gamers: even the developers have a hard time beating the game on Insane mode ;)\n\nTime is ticking, can you stop this galactic doomsday?",

Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions!\n\nThe Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.\n\nThe Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too\u2026\n\nThe Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all!\n\nThe Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits.\n\nThe Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover. Plunder cash from fallen enemies and use it to pimp up your jetboard, jetsuit and max out your weapons for a formidable arsenal. Are you up to the challenge?\n",

Only one person can wield C.A.R.D.S to take control of Protego\u2019s scattered spy crews and save the world.\n\nYou.\n\nGuided by Protego\u2019s only remaining analyst, Jim Ratio (Greg Miller), you must master the unique powers of each crew in a game of tactical Solitaire like none you\u2019ve ever played before. Guide your crews home in a tale of intrigue where nobody can be trusted. Keep your cool in a world of AI spies and cyber-enhanced operators.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken back control of Protego, play infinitely via Skirmish, or test your skills against the clock in Countdown, a survival mode that will test your grasp of the game\u2019s surprising tactical depths. For a new challenge every day take part in the Daily Hotspot leaderboards!\n\nKey Features:\n* Five modes and counting makes this the biggest Bithell Short yet! Campaign tells a tightly packed story and introduces the game\u2019s mechanics. For an added challenge, take on Campaign Plus instead, with its turn limits and locked tables requiring optimal tactics. The popular Countdown mode tests your endurance with wave after wave of unique decks. Skirmish gives you an infinite playground to enjoy unlocked crews. And, finally, the Daily Hotspot tosses crews into a new bite-size challenge every day.\n* Beautiful original character artwork and atmospheric design put you at the heart of your own cyberpunk conspiracy.\n* No heightened game of Solitaire would be complete without full FMV cutscenes, featuring Greg Miller and Inel Tomlinson in an original story from the team behind Thomas Was Alone, Volume, Subsurface Circular and John Wick Hex.\n* The Return of The Merry and Atlantis Project add new cards, new music and new FMV cutscenes featuring Samantha B\u00e9art and Alanah Pearce.\n* The soundtrack for your adventures is provided by the incomparable Jon Everist.",

Death itself is not a good enough excuse for a Soviet man!\n\n\u2022 Enhance the capabilities of Boris's body which helps him work better. Although Boris is physically fit, there is always room for improvement! \n\u2022 The enemy never sleeps, and he\u2019s incredibly cunning.

        "description": "Last Stop is a single-player third-person adventure set in present day London.  \n\nWritten and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters. \n\n- Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. \n\n- John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. \n\n- Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. \n\nLast Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising stars Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith and Kassian Akhtar as Dylan Hughes. \n\nLast Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. \n\nRoleplay as 3 unique characters. Make choices to shape their conversations. Walk in their shoes and discover where their individual stories lead. ",

Manage their daily life and help them overcome their difficulties to create their best day ever.\n\nEXPERIENCE 4 RICH STORIES\nIn Waters City, the picture is not all bright. Emma, Jordan, Paul and Jenny won't say otherwise: they face many injustices on a daily basis and need your help to face these trials. Get to know them and achieve their goals by making good decisions with them.\n\nYOUR CHOICES HAVE A REAL IMPACT\nEach story has multiple endings. It is YOUR decisions that will change the events experienced by the characters and trace their path to their best day ever. And what if these seemingly independent stories were finally linked together?\n\nENDEARING CHARACTERS\n\u2022 Emma Nadger: Manager in the food company KraKer, Emma provides quality work and doesn't count her hours. However, she regularly receives sexist remarks from some of her peers and can no longer stand it.\n\u2022 Jordan Neal: Jordan is a key player in the Waters University basketball team. The team has qualified for the big university tournament, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the team members. His partner feels this is the perfect opportunity for Jordan to finally introduce him to his teammates.\n\u2022 Jenny: As a student at the prestigious Waters University, Jenny has always had good grades. However, a few weeks before her midterms, she can no longer focus on her studies and is anxious about getting to class.\n\u2022 Paul Hitik: Paul is one of the 5 candidates in the Waters mayoral election. He is aware that his city is the place of many injustices and intends to defend his candidacy to change things on a large scale.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR RELATIVES\nWith dozens of side characters, Best Day Ever deepens many relationships of friendship, love and rivalry. To stay in touch with Emma, Jordan, Jenny and Paul's friends, the phone is your best ally. You can send and receive calls, messages or keep an eye on important appointments.",

However, since 2000, various non-governmental terrorist groups have been formed. In 2030, the ISS, the largest terrorist organization united all terrorist groups around the world and started to dominate cities. The ISS has become the most threatening terrorist organization in the world. At that time, new energy source was discovered that could change the future of humankind. The United Nations and NASA have sent a research team to investigate the new energy source. The ISS knew the value of the new energy source, terrorized major cities and occupied the energy source. From that time on, unexplained incidents such as network shutdowns, infectious diseases, mysterious deaths and mysterious aircraft crashes began to occur all over the world. The United Nations has concluded that these incidents are related to newly discovered energy source. The United Nations has formed Counter Recon Special Force with competent veterans to stop terrorism. The mission of the Counter Recon Special Force is to rescue researchers detained in each city and retrieve the energy source occupied by the ISS.",

        "description": "Sunblaze is a brain-twisting precision platformer with hundreds of challenging, handcrafted levels to keep you dying for hours and hours.\n\n\u201dWhose blood is that on the walls?\u201d -Josie\n\nJosie is up for a challenge. Her dad, a retired superhero, has fixed his superhero training simulator and lets Josie go in there to play around a bit. After all, show us a parent who wouldn't want to train their daughter to be a superhero? But then suddenly the training room goes rogue, and... Josie is up for a challenge.\n\nIn this tough, hand-crafted precision platformer, you\u2019ll play as Josie, aka. Sunblaze, with a mission to complete your superhero training. The training room is full of puzzles, brain-tickling challenges, obstacles, TNT, spikes, drones... And a purrfect sidekick: the cat. You have got a cat. What else do you need?\n\nWell, skills. That\u2019s what you need. The ever-changing training room keeps on bringing you challenge after challenge, and you'll stay glued up on your controller for hours.\n\nBeing a parent is hard, but most likely not this hard\n\nOk, all the parents who have not lost their kids in a mall or other crowd ever, raise your hands? It's all good, at least you didn't lose them in a hostile superhero simulator full of lasers, evil bots, spikes, and... Well, go and see for yourself!\n\nWARNING: Playing Sunblaze may cause massive brain growth\n\nYou know, to survive all the levels, your brain needs to do some work. We know, we know, it might sound scary, but like Aristotle said: \"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.\", and Quentin Tarantino put it even better: \"Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.\"\n\nOh, are you still reading? Go and get playing right now! We will promise you one thing: dying over 5000 times on one game has never felt this good.\n\n(P.S. Dying is 100% optional, the already easy controls and gameplay can be customized with accessibility features to meet your own needs and wants.)",

A black flow cuts through stone and threatens to spill once more across the world. The ancient tetraform calls, and with it come unearthly powers. Catapult yourself through the air, use the power drawn from fallen creatures to slow time, and cut through the swarms of dark beings with a razor-edge boomerang.

Speed is everything, and only the nimblest boomerang-er will survive\u2026\n\nPowers From Beyond:\nFight otherworldly forces and look cool doing it. Impress the boomerang with stylish tricks and it\u2019ll grant you stranger powers \u2014 powers that\u2019ll let you defeat the forces of the depths with greater ease. Kaspidae smiles upon you and your killer moves\u2026\n\nFoul Creatures of Goo:\nThey creep and crawl from crevices... swoop and dive from the treetops\u2026 and spray nasty bile at you from all angles. Keep your wits about you - nowhere is safe. Whatever you do, don\u2019t stand still, or you\u2019ll surely be consumed...\n\nAvenge a Fallen Realm:\nFight your way through the bowels of ruined civilization undone by these creatures of nightmare and stop them spreading to the rest of your world. Something lurks deep underneath these ruined halls, spewing corruption\u2026 can you defeat whatever it is? And even if you can\u2026 will that really be the end?\n\n",

Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome.\n\u2026and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe.\n\nFLYING AMONG THE STARS\n\nYou are the commander of the \u201cMelistar\u201d (\u201cThe Star Bee\u201d), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.\n\nOTHER SPECIES\n\nThe ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you\u2019ll be forming an alliance with, and who you\u2019ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy...\nWe\u2019ll have to fight and trade \u2013 and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story.\n\nSURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING\n\n* You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out \u2013 and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course \u2013 and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record!\n* If you like branching plots and world exploration \u2013 boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past \u2013 and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not.\n\nMANY EVENTS\n\nAs you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband \u201cset-up\u201d or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly. But the choices within each event will also have to be considered...\n\n...Subjects with the waist of a wasp and a deadly sting; predatory rivals and faction battles; exploring the farthest corners of the galaxy; dangerous challenges and responsible decisions.\nWelcome to the world of CyberHive!\nCommander, we are counting on you.",

Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots.\nFrom thriving villages to crumbling cities, petrified forests and bone-dry ocean beds, this strange new world holds a multitude of terrains to uncover, beautifully rendered in 2D isometric art. Explore, solve puzzles and be prepared to face many tough choices that will shape this land long after you complete your journey.\n \nUNFORGETTABLE FACES\n\nHumanity as you know it has been totally reforged, and that is most evident by the characters in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION. Technology and mortality have become blurred. Sentient religious robots run rife. Trans-humanistic tribes and leaders have emerged to claim power, and ruthless hunter mercenaries roam the plains. All have adapted to this powerful unknown, and are often at odds with each other. Meet and interact with over forty unique characters, each fully voiced by African voice actors, with thousands of lines of dialogue and multiple conversation paths. Additionally, full CGI cutscenes are scattered throughout the story to bring you even closer to the enthralling sci-fi world and its characters,\n\nMASTERFUL MUSIC SCORE\n\nBEAUTIFUL DESOLATION features a vibrant and highly experimental soundtrack by none other than Mick Gordon.\n \nREVAMPED FOR CONSOLE CONTROLLERS\n\nBEAUTIFUL DESOLATION's controls, UI and movement have been fully redone to work intuitively on console controllers.\n",

        "description": "In Football Drama, you are Rocco Galliano, the Marseillaise new manager of Calchester Assembled Football Club.\nAfter the abrupt ending of your coaching career seven years ago, the hysterical attention of the press quickly faded. But struggling results by Calchester FC convinced Boris Aluminovitch, its billionaire president, to axe the previous beleaguered manager and give you a new chance.\nWill your raucous shouts from the bench change the fate of the team? Will you find wiseness and karma leadership with the help of the Book of Changes? Will your shady past reach back to you and make you crumble?\n\nChances that you can make it through a full season are slim. Corruption, crime, drugs and romance are all paths that you may take - for better or worse. This is the only football game where you may lose the championship and win the game!\n\nKey features:\n- Interactive narrative with meaningful game-changing choices.\n- Karma or chaos: life choices, game choices.\n- Turn-based match play with live-action animations.\n- 18 dramatic weeks of procedural championship where you can be fired at any time.\n- Deck-building mechanics determined by life choices and game results.\n- Ridiculous cards about the craziest aspects of today's football\nIllustrated log of each of your matches.\n- Silly main commentator with his obligatory colourful sidekick.\n- Replayable - every championship is unique, several different endings.",

The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. \n\nThe game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life.\n\nRenovate and decorate train stations and trains.\nDetailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements.\n\nBuild your own station.\nThanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.\n\nChoose how hard you want to work.\nThe level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.\n",

Protected by a glass dome, Endeavor rises above the once lively area and worker robots are trying their best to keep it going. In order to maintain it, every robot has to do its job perfectly and any imperfections found are being discarded.\n\nThrown to a junkyard for a malfunction, a single robot worker is on a quest to get itself fixed. But the city sees this loyal worker as a threat now, so all the robots and defenses that protect Endeavor have turned against their former colleague. With the unique ability to control various machines of the city, including any robots that are in the way, this little Robot is on a mission to fix himself and find intelligent life.\n\nYet it seems that there is no intelligent life left. Only the robots programmed to keep the city nice and clean for people who are nowhere to be found.\n\n\nKey Features\n\nYou are on your own\nLong ago humans vanished leaving behind only their robotic creations. Now the world they left behind is falling apart. Is there anyone out there to help you fix it and discover what happened to the people who used to live here?\n\nYour enemies are your tools\nAlone in the world, the little robot has a special trick up his sleeve: the ability to hack and gain control of any other machines. Use them as you like: you can make them fight each other, explore unreachable places, solve puzzles, or just accompany you in your journey. There are dozens of robots with different abilities for you to explore.\n\nEnjoy hand-drawn visuals\nThe art style of Retro Machina is based on illustrations from the science fiction books of the twentieth century. Set in the retro-futuristic universe, the game is inspired by the work of such legendary people as Jacque Fresco, one of the most famous futurists in the world.\n\nExplore the multifaceted world\nFrom underground facilities to the golden streets of Endeavour, the last city on the planet, your journey will take you across a whole region filled with new challenges, new robots, and mysteries to explore.\n",

Whatever you choose, make sure to excel, gather reputation points for your actions, and obtain access to the most challenging and best-paid missions.\n\nThe more money you earn, the better (and bigger!) space fleet you\u2019ll be able to build, consisting of fast and maneuverable fighters, heavy bombers, and large transporters.

I\u2019ve received the cd you had sent me and after a cursory glance at the files, I have to say the chances of recovering the software seem promising. There seems to be some data corruption but it\u2019s quite possible it may still run.\n\nNow, again, I haven\u2019t really dug too deep into it but it appears that it\u2019s some sort of a simple game. I\u2019ve seen plenty of things labelled as \u201cmap\u201d so it probably has many levels. Pretty sure it involves some sort of a gun also? My guess is, it\u2019s most likely one of those retro shooters.\n\nAnyway, gonna go take a nap. Couldn\u2019t really get much sleep last night; had a lot of nightmares, can\u2019t quite remember about what. I\u2019ll keep you updated on my progress.\n\nSincere regards,\nDavid",

Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 2,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!\n\nRevolver and Co features 105 story levels across 7 unique worlds and 12 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission.\n\nOr if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long session where the only thing you have to lose is time.",

        "intro": "Adapt and overcome glitches in an ever-changing digital world!",
        "description": "Paradox Error is a surreal take on the scrolling platformer format, combining minimalistic black-and-white presentation with self-aware, fourth wall breaking design. Glitches are intentionally integrated, allowing the player to cheat death, open new areas by triggering bugs or leap off of UI elements as if they\u2019re part of the stage. The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death.\n\nTo survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world!\n\u2022 Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective.\n\u2022 Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive.\n\u2022 Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style.\n\u2022 Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!",

As you master its logic, Induction will rewire how you think about cause and effect.\n\nAcross more than 50 meticulously designed puzzles, you must explore the counter-intuitive possibilities time travel permits. You will learn to choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.\n\nEach puzzle is crafted to reveal a unique aspect of the game\u2019s elegant yet exacting internal logic, gently guiding you into realising the potential of your powers. Induction does not pander, but gives you the satisfaction of mastering an imaginary yet honest set of physical laws.\n\nAccompanying Induction\u2019s minimalist visuals is a rich and responsive ambient soundtrack by Melbourne-based electronic composer and radio broadcaster Tim Shiel.",

Some of those goddesses even went on to become idols.\nHowever, there were others who simply refused to follow the rules. These goddesses prefer living freely and doing as they please, inadvertently causing all sorts of trouble for humans.\n\nGoddesses who are naughty are called Aragami.\n\nThe protagonist, Sho Narumi, stumbles upon a goddess who collapses on the street and attempts to help her. Soon enough it is revealed that she's the Aragami who had been causing frequent power outages in one small-town area of Tokyo. Sho decides to protect his beloved hometown by helping the goddess to get rehabilitated!\n\n\"Rehabilitate the goddess!\"\n\nWait...aren't goddesses supposed to help humans?\n\nWith the setting moving from Akihabara to a quiet small-town area of Tokyo, the story of one naughty goddess's rehabilitation begins now!",

        "intro": "Fates of Ort is a retro fantasy RPG focused on strategic action, in a land where time is frozen when you stand still. Cast powerful spells - but beware, they will cost you your life. ",
        "description": "Magic is powerful, but it is not free. Every spell you cast requires a little bit of your life energy to spark it. Cast enough spells and you will extinguish your very soul. This means you need to be strategic when fighting, balancing the cost of magic with the risk of taking damage from your enemies.\n\nHow each spell manifests in the world depends on what divine power you choose to combine it with. For example, the Evoke Force spell will cause the ground to erupt with a series of sharp ice crystals, summon a thunderous lightning strike, or barrage the ground with a meteor shower \u2013 all depending on what the spell is combined with.\n\nUse the magic spells at your disposal to defeat the demons spilling out from the underworld. In Ort, time is frozen whenever you stand still. This means you have the opportunity to plan your attacks and be strategic.\n\nLike any RPG, you will be slaying enemies to collect loot and experience. The items you pick up will improve your magical abilities, though some come with curses... As you level up, you will learn additional magic spells to use against your enemies.\n\nOrt is varied and expansive, an open world for you to explore. Choose the order of the quests you pursue, or just explore to meet new characters. The final battle is available whenever you choose, but... Are you strong enough?\n\nPlay as a novice mage, forced to take on the responsibility of saving the world and those that are important to you. Quests can be completed to gain access to new areas, save and unlock allies, gain items and powers, and more. Replays are encouraged because small decisions can have permanent and significant consequences, leading to different game outcomes.",

Like we've already mentioned, our game is a mix between Roguelite and Dungeon Management. How did we achieve that? By running many tests to find the perfect balance between management and dungeon phases!\n\nDungeon Phase\n\nFirst, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin! \n\nYou will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler: heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you placed. When a group of adventurers encounters a group of monsters you positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!\n",

From a simple game of tag to a run-and-jump obstacle course, each lesson is broken down into multiple, manageable segments that let kids go at their own pace\u2014and have fun in the process.\n\nLearn the basics of visual game programming \n\nBy playing through interactive lessons, kids will learn the basics of visual game programming. Nodon, colorful creatures with distinct personalities, keep kids engaged through lessons with tips and motivating messages. With a simple press of a button, swap between the programming screen and the game screen\u2014watch how programming changes the game on the fly.\n\nTrack progress and build confidence\n\nAfter completing each lesson and building a game, kids will test their knowledge by completing Checkpoints\u2014small puzzles or tasks to solve with programming. Master these skills and head to Free Programming mode to let your imagination (and programming chops) run wild.\n\nThe Nodon you meet each have distinct personalities that complement their functions. Have fun connecting them together to see how they interact and bring your game to life. The in-game Nodopedia lets you quickly check what each Nodon does as you create. There\u2019s also a guide that recaps important skills! Easily swap between the Programming and Game screens to see the hard-working Nodon in action.\n\nTake advantage of the Nintendo Switch system\u2019s many features. Instead of the control stick, program motion controls to control your game. Want to create some competition? Add in a multiplayer function and pass a Joy-Con\u2122 controller to a friend. It\u2019s up to you (and your Nodon friends) to decide what type of game you want to make.\n\nLooking for inspiration? Exchange codes and download* games from friends. You can even go into Free Programming mode to look at those downloaded games\u2019 programming and put your own twist on it. Upload your own creations and share them with other Game Builder Garage players*. Learn programming, build games, and share with friends!",

You play as Perry, a severely dehydrated man who stumbles into a remote village in search of help, but the inhabitants respond with strange detachment to your trouble.

And before you know it, you will be chased by bees, fending off bears, cursed by gypsies, and most likely set on fire. Will the crises ever end!?\n\nMerrily Perilly plays like a top down adventure game where you must resolve the perpetual perils that afflict Perry by interacting with the townsfolk and environment. Through exploration and experimentation, the nonlinear narrative branches and intersects into many paths leading to several distinct endings.\n\nFeatures:\n-Fast-paced Gameplay\n-6 different Endings\n-Non-linear Exploration & Narrative\n-Hats! Make sure to collect all of 'em\n-Unlockable Trophies & Achievements\n-Secrets, Puzzles, & Easter Eggs\n-Bees. Lots of Bees.",

        "description": "FEATURES:\n- You can fly as a squirrel-man and feel the \u201creal\u201d simulator.\n- Interactive shop, many hidden puzzles and things to press.\n- Cows.\n- Senseless physics.\n- More cows.\n- Endless level to gain money and beat records.\n- Did I mentioned about the cows?\n- Probably? A lot of bugs!\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nSo, you\u2019re a guy in a wingsuit, who really likes to fly in his wingsuit, do crazy stunts, earn money, spend it on more wingsuit flying gadgets, get trophies, that kind of boring stuff.\nRight?\n\nWRONG!\nCow Catcher is an unusual wingsuit flight simulator.\nYou become Strange Wingsuit Man, whose goal in life is to fly around, steal random cows and wave his hands like a madman while he\u2019s at it.\nYou might want to think of it as a hobby\u2026\nSTEAL SOME AMAZING COWS\n\nYou\u2019re job is to kidnap some amazing cows by attaching a rope to them and then transporting them to your pen.\nBeware though, for the flight is dark and full of\u2026 ok, that\u2019s not the story, we beg your pardon.\nHave you ever handled a cow, high up in the air?\nNo? Well, that\u2019s a shame, but we\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s done.\nYou have to be very careful not to steer your cow in any of the obstacles awaiting you during your flight.\nI mean, why would you want to go hitting a cow against\u2026things?\nThat would be crazy.\nKeep in mind, that typical cows usually wriggle during rope-secured flights.\nWe know that kind of stuff, duh.\nEARN COWCOINS\nFor every kidnapped cow you will be earning cowcoins, obviously. When you\u2019ve earned enough of the marvellous currency, it\u2019s time to go shopping! Sure, you can buy some reasonable gear, which will enhance your flying (why would you do that?) or you can exchange your money for a crazy beak, which will match your mad flapping (highly recommended)!\nWhat else will you find in the virtual store?\nYou will have to play to find out!",

        "description": "Skittles is a game of skill in which the goal is to score exactly fifty points by knocking down pins numbered 1 through 12 with a throw of a wooden stick.\n\nThis Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer.\n \nThe player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down:\n\nIf he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin;\nIf he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points);\nIf a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted.\nFallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary.\n\nThe winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25.\n\nSo as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins or the number 2 pin and only that one pin. If the score is 49, the only solution is to knock down the number 1 pin and no other pins.\n\nThe first player or team to reach 50 points wins the game.\n\nMain features:\n-Full 3D\n-AAA Graphic Engine\n-AAA Physic Engine\n-6 skittle sets with different physical parameters\n-4 Sceneries\n-From one to 4 players",

Your weapon is a magical wooden staff that brave Theofil uses to destroy his enemies. His abilities will help you fight against dangerous enemies.\n\nThe action takes place somewhere in ancient Egypt, full of mysterious temples and caves, which are protected by deadly traps. Access to them is defended by powerful opponents who will not give up without a fight. Stone golems throwing boulders at you and goblins wanting to stab you with a spear. You'll find it all in Theofil!\n\nWatch out for sharp spikes popping out of the ground, fire-breathing ancient statues with images of deities, and flying, poisonous blades. Avoid them to prevent your health bar from dropping to zero. Your dexterity will be the key to discovering the secrets of the ancient world, as their guardians protect access to them. They are cunning and attack you in a group, so keep your eyes around the head!\n\nIn addition to traps and enemies, you will solve puzzles that require cleverness and logical thinking. Move big statues and switch levers to open gates. Jump on platforms to reach the hidden treasures of the ancient world.\n\nTravel through the winding corridors of mysterious temples, bristling with traps appearing on each wall and find a hiding place with a powerful boss. Defeat him to get new items and grow in strength with Theofil! Will you manage to go through the dangerous journey and discover the secrets of the ancient world? Enter the mysterious world of Theofil and follow the path with him! ",

        "description": "Demons of Asteborg\u00ae is an original and challenging new 2D game, mixing action, small puzzles and strategy. This 16-bit game will bring back many memories for retro fans.\nThe story\n\nLong ago in the Kingdom of Asteborg, a war broke out, pitting humans and demons against each other in a bloody battle. Sagramor, a powerful mercenary, and Maria, a sorceress with fighting magic, joined forces to defeat the demonic army.\nSagramor found a way to lock the demons in an alternate dimension, at the cost of his own life. His sacrifice earned him the title of \"Legend of Asteborg\".\n\nShortly before the end of the war, Maria gave birth to a child named Gareth.\nShe died 4 years later.\n\nGareth was then taken in by the royal orphanage, and Bohort, the leader of the armed troops, saw in him an invaluable potential. He trained him from an early age to become a formidable warrior.\n\nDecades later, Zadimus, the former leader of the Demons, who survived the great war, found a way to reopen the portal to the parallel dimension in order to free his fellow Demons and declare war on the humans in order to take back the Kingdom of Asteborg.\n\nAs Gareth, now the royal guard of Asteborg, you will go on an adventure, braving the lands of the kingdom and its dangerous lands populated by bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nAlong the way, you'll learn more and more about the ancient war and your identity.\nBut beware, Zadimus won't let you get away with it...",

        "intro": "Hindsight 20/20 is an action RPG with morality decisions from BioWare and Sucker Punch veterans. Discover the power of your morality with choices/actions that truly matter.",
        "description": "Hindsight 20/20 - Wrath of the Raakshasa is a 3D third-person action RPG where players can fix mistakes from past playthroughs and relive them for vastly different gameplay and story experiences. Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences. \n\nHindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars:\n\n1. Choice in Combat: \nDecide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good. \n\n2. A Malleable World: \nChampaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan\u2019s choices and actions.\n\n3. Interesting AI and Bosses: \nAll NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20\u2019s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan. \n\n4. The Experience Engine: \nThe Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20.\n\n5. Ten different endings:\nHindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey.",

This and all other modes can be played online*, too!\n\n100 classic minigames return from the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube\u2122 games and more!\n\nTry your hand at a Superstar collection of minigames from throughout the Mario Party series. Whether you are saving up coins for stars in board game mode or practicing in free play, there is nothing quite like being the last one standing in Mushroom Mix-Up or Shy Guy Says. All minigames are played with button controls, so you can stick to the Joy-Con\u2122 controller or bust out the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller or a Nintendo Switch Lite system.\n\nParty with superstars near or far\n\nBring the party anytime, anywhere with same-system**, local wireless**, or online* play. Matches with friends in board game mode save each turn, so feel free to take a break and pick up where you left off. Use stickers to praise or pester fellow players as you race across the board collecting stars. All modes support online multiplayer, so you can hop in with friends for a few minigames or a marathon 30-turn match. Victory is just as sweet (and stealing stars is just as satisfying) from anywhere across the globe.",

This remake features two campaigns that cover the events of Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising!\n\nFight alongside capable Commanding Officers\n\nDefend your land with the help of Andy, Max, Sami, and other Commanding Officers, each with their own specialties and CO Powers. Andy can repair units, while Sami can boost the abilities of troops. Your opponents can use CO abilities of their own too! Throughout both campaigns, the COs you meet play a critical role both on the battlefield and in the story.\n\nRecruit some friends and see who the superior strategist is\n\nWhen you aren\u2019t busy keeping the peace in one of the two campaign stories, flex your army-commanding chops in Versus Mode*. Up to four players can battle on dozens of maps. Each player chooses a CO from either campaign and can strategically use their CO Powers to turn the tides of battle. Customize your combat with options like funds per allied base and fog of war.\n",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION\nHave a Blast is a high energy, kinetic, multiplayer party game. Battle through the most ridiculously hazardous corners of the galaxy and use your surroundings to your advantage. Outmaneuver your frenemies and shatter them into colorful bits. \n\n\nARENAS\nBattle around the galaxy in fifteen arenas, with new ones coming. Classic asteroids, icy comets, mythical monsters, curious contraption, it is all there for you to chart a route before the match. Each arena puts you in perils, which you can turn into opportunities and use to your advantage \n\nSHIPS\nAll the ships in Have a Blast are small and nimble, enabling you to navigate the busy arenas. Each of the five ships has a unique powerful ability, requiring a slightly different approach. But even the strongest attacks can be countered, and it is never too late to turn the tide of battle to your side. \n\nGAME MODES\nDeathmatch \u2013 Last pilot standing wins the round in this familiar mode. Be the first to win five rounds and you win the match. \n\nTeam match \u2013 Any combination of players is possible in a team vs team play. Great opportunity to reinforce some friendships and ruin others. \n\nMothership \u2013 Keep your mothership safe and it will provide you with health, ammo and some refuge. Lose your mothership and you\u2019ll be toast very soon. \n\nChallenges - Try every ship and every environment by completing specific challenges against the computer. \n\n\nBOTS\nAdd bots to any match. Driven by a capable AI, they can provide some challenge when friends are not around; or you can use them to add energy to matches. If the adaptive AI gets frustrating or too easy, you can always adjust the challenge from the menu. \n\n\nWE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR RETRO-INSPIRED MODERN-DESIGNED ARCADE!",

        "description": "Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we\u2019ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here\u2019s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it\u2019s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n\nFeatures:\nNew levels: You\u2019ve got a new level that\u2019s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who\u2019s finished the game at least once. You\u2019ve got another (poorly) hidden level, for the masochists who know that there is a Boss Cell 5\nNew Bosses: Mirroring the above, you\u2019ve got a new completely different type of boss available in the main level structure, with another INSANELY difficult boss hidden behind even more ridiculously difficult content.\nNew content: There are 10 new enemies, 13 new weapons/skills and a bunch of other upgrades to core game systems. There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and\u2026\nSkins: People have been requesting this for ages and we\u2019ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accommodate the request. You\u2019ve now got access to female skins, fluo skins and a Christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.\n\nOn top of these major changes we\u2019re continuously trying to update the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we\u2019re not done, we\u2019ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you\u2019d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.",

        "intro": "Build Your Greatest Empire on Nintendo Switch\u2122",
        "description": "Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI Expansion Bundle, which combines both Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, takes the turn-based strategy classic to new heights. With 16 new civilizations, 18 new leaders, and major enhancements to gameplay such as Great Ages and an active planet where geology and climatology present unique new challenges, the pursuit of building the greatest empire becomes as exciting as it has ever been in the Civilization franchise.\n\nThe Civilization VI Expansion Bundle contains all features from the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, that includes: \n\n\u2022NEW LEADERS AND CIVS: Combined together, sixteen new civilizations and eighteen new leaders are introduced. Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as unique units, districts, wonders, buildings, and more. \n\n\u2022GREAT AGES: As your civilization ebbs and flows and you reach milestone Historic Moments, you will move towards Dark Ages or Golden Ages, each providing specific challenges or bonuses based on your actions in game. Rise triumphantly from a Dark Age, and your next Golden Age will be even stronger \u2013 a Heroic Age.\n\n\u2022LOYALTY: Cities now have individual Loyalty to your leadership \u2013 let it fall too low, and face the consequences of low yields, revolts, and the potential to lose your city if it declares its own independence. But one civilization\u2019s loss can be your gain as you inspire Loyalty among cities throughout the map and further expand your borders.\n\n\u2022GOVERNORS: Recruit, appoint, and upgrade powerful characters with unique specialization bonuses and promotion trees to customize your cities, and reinforce Loyalty.\n\n\u2022ENHANCED ALLIANCES: An enhanced alliances system allows players to form different types of alliances and build bonuses over time.\n\n\u2022EMERGENCIES: When a civilization grows too powerful, other civilizations can join a pact against the threatening civilization, and earn rewards, or penalties, when the Emergency ends.\n\n\u2022TIMELINE: Review your civilization\u2019s history at any time with the new Timeline feature, a visual journey through the Historic Moments that you encountered on your path to victory. \n\n\u2022ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sandstorms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts bring the world to life in a brand-new way. Your settlement choices are more important than ever as you balance high risks and high rewards. \n\n\u2022POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES: Strategic resources play an additional role. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you\u2019ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world\u2019s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. \n\n\u2022ENGINEERING PROJECTS: Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles.\n\n\u2022WORLD CONGRESS: Make your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory. \n\n\u202221st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES & CIVICS: A new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions.",

Yes, that song is included.\n\nSephiroth strikes fear into his opponent\u2019s heart by using a combination of heavy strikes and deadly magic. His neutral special attack, Flare, launches an exploding fireball. Hold it down long enough to pull off a devastating Gigaflare, but with shorter range. Nothing instils a sense a dread like Sephiroth\u2019s side special, Shadow Flare. This quick blast of energy surrounds your opponent and eventually explodes\u2014it can also be stacked 5 times!  In addition to these malicious maneuvers, Sephiroth can slash in any direction at high speed with his up special, Blade Dash / Octaslash, and he can create a protective barrier with his down special, Scintilla. \n \nWhen at a disadvantage, such has having more damage than his opponent, a wing can grow from Sephiroth\u2019s back. In this demonically angelic state, his power and movement speed is increased, Smash Attacks gain Super Armor, and he can even jump up to three times in the air. The greater disadvantage you\u2019re at, such as in damage, score, or stock, the easier it will be for the wing to grow. Sephiroth is at his most powerful when he uses his Final Smash, Supernova. After a wide slash, Sephiroth unleashes an incredible explosion that deals damage and sometimes status effects! With his Masamune blade in hand and destruction on his mind, Sephiroth is a force to be reckoned with.\n",

Kazuya\u2019s fighting style captures the distinct style of the Tekken series as he gets up close and personal with heavy strikes and incredible comeback power. His specials tap into his Devil Gene with moves like the beam-shooting Devil Blaster and high-flying Devil Wings. The son of Tekken icon Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya has a chip on his shoulder and destructive power.\n\nWhat makes Kazuya Mishima unique in this game are his standard attacks\u2014rather than 4 directional standard attacks, he has 8. This addition of diagonal inputs mimics his abilities in the Tekken games and make him an unpredictable fighter with a lot of combo options. The stage added with this fighter is the Mishima Dojo, which starts out with all four directions closed off. A strong launch or direct attack can shatter the walls and ceilings, allowing for opponents to get KO\u2019d. \n\nTekken rated TEEN by the ESRB. \n\n",

ILI, an autonomous android who for some reason works at Dream Club, apparently wants to prove her true potential by saving the Earth. Despite being an android, performance-wise she is comparable to a human. With her innocent heart (AI?), she would never shoot beams from her eyes, or do anything of that sort. But hoping to find batteries, she was coaxed into joining the EDF and modded into a tool of destruction: for her Ability she can float in midair, and for her SP Move she causes javelins to rain from the sky. Although she really only needs manganese batteries to function, for her weapon she's been equipped with a massive automatic shotgun paired with a reflector shield. Now, THIS is pure power.",

Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",
