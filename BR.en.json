You'll eventually get the hang of GoNNER, so don't lose your head. But even if you do it's okay cause we have a lot of replacement heads you can use.\n\nPROCEDURALLY GENERATED! Every time you play the game the levels will be different and present unique challenges and opportunities.\n\nUNLOCKS! You'll be able to choose from a variety of passive and active abilities at the beginning of each run so be sure to experiment with all of them and find the play style that best suits you.\n\nSECRETS! Secret areas exist in the world of GoNNER, and these areas will get you different items that you can then always use from the beginning of each run. We're not going to tell you how you get to these areas or what the criteria is for even finding them because secrets, duh.\n\nMUSIC! It's really freaking good.\n\nGood luck.",

        "intro": "A new challenger has appeared \nin the platform fighter arena!",
        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale. \n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre\u2019s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you\u2019re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout.\nThere are currently six original characters and four popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles:\n-\tDead Cells\n-\tYooka-Laylee\n-\tGuacamelee\n-\tHyper Light Drifter\nAs well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout\u2019s cast numbers 25 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that\u2019s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.\n\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you\u2019d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either Timed, Stock, Team Battles, FFA or Party Modes:\n-\tAll on the same device\n-\tEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing nearby\n-\tOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players\nAI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers and the all new Trials mode.",

Sharpen your knives and dust off your chef\u2019s whites, there isn\u2019t mushroom for error and the steaks are high in these crazy kitchens!\n\nOn the Nintendo Switch\u2122, you can now experience the crazy couch co-operative action of Overcooked wherever you choose. Simply remove the Nintendo Switch console from the Nintendo Switch Dock\u2122 to take your culinary adventures on the road, just like our plucky chefs travelling around the Onion Kingdom!\n\nThe Onion Kingdom is in danger and only the finest cooking can save it! In Overcooked players must journey through a variety of cruel and unusual kitchens on their quest to become master chefs capable of conquering an ancient edible evil which plagues the land.\n\nOvercooked Special Edition features all the exhilarating (and enraging) kitchens from the main game, as well as both expansions, \u2018The Lost Morsel\u2019 and \u2018Festive Seasoning\u2019.\n\nA CULINARY QUEST\nThe Onion Kingdom is a rich world full of cruel and unusual kitchens for you to conquer. Take part in an epic journey and tackle an increasingly challenging and bizarre gauntlet of kitchens which will push your skills of co-operation and \nco-ordination to the very limits. Each level brings a new challenge for you and your team to overcome, whether it's sliding around on a pirate ship, moving between speeding trucks, cooking on an ice floe or serving food in the bowels of a fiery underworld, each level will test the mettle of even the bravest chefs.\n\nSIMPLE CONTROLS/DEEP CHALLENGE\nOvercooked is so easy to pick up that anyone can join in the fun, but finding a team who can communicate and co-ordinate their actions when the pizza hits the fan, that's when only a\nwell-oiled team of super-chefs will come out on top!\n\nWith Nintendo Switch HD Rumble, become immersed in the crazy culinary antics like never before.\n\nDIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY\nWhether indulging in deep fried local co-op or saut\u00e9ed single player, as you play through the game you'll unlock new levels, new chef characters and even competitive challenge levels which allow teams of two to engage in hard boiled head-to-head in the kitchen.\n\nJust like cooking itself, Overcooked is best enjoyed with friends! Call in backup from a buddy by detaching the Joy-Con\u2122 controllers and get to work! Add in an extra set of Joy-Con controllers or two Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers\u2122 and you can play with up to four players for even more frantic fun.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to cook a range of different dishes and work together in order to become the most effective and ultimate team! However you want to play, if you think you can stand the heat, then get ready to enter the kitchen!\n",

Whilst exploring the Sparkle Void, you find various nutritious elements to eat. Sometimes you will even have to fight for food with other species. You become what you eat - you get to choose whether your sparkle becomes a fast and aggressive carnivore, a sluggish but fast-eating herbivore, or an omnivore, whose features lie somewhere in between. Insight to your Sparkle's DNA strand will give you information about the progress and will help you plan which microelements you want to focus on eating next. You will also get to fight giant bosses from time to time.\n\nBut there\u2019s no rush to keep the game in full swing at all times. You may as well just relax, play the game on a slow pace, explore the sparkle void, consume nutritional elements, enjoy simple and surreal surrounding and listen to the ambient music soundtrack.

A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips, grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each and every run.\n\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s YOUR skills as a player that matter most! Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you\u2019ll get better!\u2026 eventually.\n\nFeatures:\n\nRogueVania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.\n\n2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than 90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay\u2026 The unforgiving action wed to the absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and every run. \n\nNonlinear progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts?

        "description": "The First Tree is a third-person exploration game centered around two parallel stories: a fox trying to find her missing family, and a son reconnecting with his estranged father in Alaska. Players take control of the fox on a poignant and beautiful journey that crescendos at the source of life, and perhaps result in an understanding of death. Along the way, players can uncover artifacts and stories from the son's life as he becomes intertwined in the fox\u2019s journey towards The First Tree.\n\nFeatures:\n\u25cf Not a \"fox simulator,\" but an emotional, intimate story by a one-man team with an ending you won't soon forget.\n\u25cf Featuring a gorgeous, orchestral soundtrack by acclaimed artists like Message to Bears, Lowercase Noises, and Josh Kramer.\n\u25cf A short story-driven game (about 2 hours long) with some light puzzle solving, platforming, and no enemies.",

        "description": "The critically-acclaimed puzzle game produced by legendary creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi arrives on the Nintendo Switch\u2122! An HD remaster of the original game, LUMINES REMASTERED beautifully marries the elements of sound, light and puzzle-action into one addictive, yet easy-to-play game. \n\nYou\u2019re at the center of the high-energy, block-dropping action while you groove to awesome house, trance and techno beats! Play LUMINES REMASTERED on-the-go in Handheld mode or at home in TV and Tabletop modes. \n\nFeel the sound: Play over 40 skins with electronic atmospheres from chill to upbeat. Shuffle skins (like a music playlist) as more are unlocked in a new Shuffle mode.\n\nFeel the challenge: Faster tempos means less time to make combos, but slower songs can mean uncleared stacks. You\u2019ll get hooked.\n\nFeel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.\n\nFeel the vibration: Turn on Trance Vibration and sync multiple Joy-Con\u2122 controllers to feel the bass across your body.",

Boasting fully realized transport and economy systems, Cities: Skylines is designed to suit any play style - and now, anytime, anywhere.\n\nMore portable than ever, the new Nintendo Switch\u2122 Edition of this best-selling city builder comes complete with reworked UI, designed especially for Switch, along with two of Cities: Skylines\u2019 most popular expansions - After Dark and Snowfall. \n\nMulti-tiered and challenging simulation: Constructing your city from the ground up is easy to learn, but hard to master. Playing as the mayor, you\u2019ll be faced with balancing essential requirements like education, healthcare and much more along with your city\u2019s real economy system. Citizens in your city react fluidly, with gravitas and an air of authenticity to a multitude of gameplay scenarios.\n\nNintendo Switch edition exclusive: Using HD Rumble, a rumble effect helps find the most efficient area to place service buildings in your city. Pro controllers are also supported, and additional tutorials help guide your first playthrough for a better learning experience.\n\nExtensive local traffic simulation: Colossal Order\u2019s extensive experience developing the Cities in Motion series is put to work in fully fleshed out, well-crafted transport systems.\n\nDistricts and Policies: Be more than just an administrator from city hall. Designating parts of your city as a district results in the application of policies which results in you rising to the status of Mayor for your own city.\n\nAfter Dark: Focused on leisure and tourist specialization, this expansion\u2019s central feature is to utilize the day and night cycle and alter the approach to managing your city. Will you construct a bustling city that lives and breathes at night, or succumb to the perils and misadventures of the dark hours? \n\nSnowfall: The difficulty heats up when the city cools down, thanks to this expansion\u2019s added challenges and assets, like snow maps, streetcars, and heating systems. There are in-game temperature readings, cosmetic weather enhancements, extra parks, and infrastructural demands to keep your citizens warm and safe from freezing conditions.",

Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts.

With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe.

Additional controller required. (Online co-op to be added in the future)\n- emotional tale focused on a family of heroes\n- a diverse set of skills\n- passive and active items modifying each run\n- multiple dungeons set in different biomes\n- a rich world full of history and magic\n- Family Trials - a mode separate from the Main Story campaign, offering new systems, items, objectives, character builds, and more - all set in a series of completely randomized dungeons.\n",

        "intro": "How will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?",
        "description": "Just Die Already is an old people mayhem sandbox game created by the designers of Goat Simulator.\n\nYou are an old retired person in a near future where people aren\u2019t having any children. There isn\u2019t anyone to pay for pensions due to those ungrateful millennials who prefer playing video games instead of doing actual work. With no one to cover your living costs, you - just like all other old people in this world - have no other choice but to survive on your own. \nHow will you survive in a world that wants you to Just Die Already?\n\nTo make things worse, you\u2019ve just been kicked out of your retirement home, and your only option now is to perform dangerous challenges and explore the world for retirement tickets to qualify for free retirement care. \nSo with society wishing you dead, isn\u2019t it finally time to live a little?\n\nFREE POST-LAUNCH PVP MODES \u2013 AVAILABLE NOW\n\nGive the boomers what they deserve by having them fight for their lives! Compete against your other old friends with this new free Player Versus Player update.\nPlay in 4 new arenas, customize your game modes and start ripping each other\u2019s limbs off. \nBrace yourself up to your nipples in your old man pants, this Old Vs Old mayhem competition is ON!\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nBE OLD, BE BOLD\nYou get to be an old person. Angry, fragile, poor and hating the world: the dream you didn\u2019t know you had until now. Finally, you have found something in common with your grandparents.\n\nBREAK A LEG... BREAK A NECK\nDiscover the joys of being old and made of glass, anything can break you and you can break your everything. \n\nDON\u2019T TRY THIS AT (RETIREMENT) HOME\nComplete dangerous challenges that you will never ever try at home and answer existential questions like: can you launch yourself from a catapult and land on someone? Or, can you survive losing your head, grabbing it and whacking someone with it?\n\nONE MISSION: RETIRE!\nEarn rewards by completing dangerous challenges, your goal? To qualify for a proper retirement home. That makes perfect sense. Word of advice: try and stay in one piece so you can enjoy it in the end\u2026\n\nSANDBOX MULTIPLAYER\nPlay alone, or with up to 4 players in online multiplayer. Complete challenges together, or just cause mayhem and rip your friends\u2019 limbs off! \n\nBE OLD. TWICE.\nYou get to be an old person. So good we said it twice.\n\nLIMITLESS INTERACTION\nPick up and interact with a very wide variety of objects. Everything from giant trouts, trampolines, guns, electrical wiring, and fireworks, just to mention a few. Bazookas, axes, trombones, air horns and jetpacks to mention a few more. Yes they all can be used to hurt and maim.\n\nEMBRACE YOUR INNER BOOMER\nWreak havoc on the millennial and zoomer population (we forgot Generation X, just like everyone else). NPCs react differently depending on their age - some will laugh and clap at others getting hurt while others will run away in terror. \n\nTHE GAME CAN BE AS CRAZY AS YOU\nThe city is filled with detailed environments, loaded with secrets and hidden paths, that encourage detailed exploration and quirky experimentation to truly see it all.\n\nOLD. PERSON.\nOkay that\u2019s the last time we promise.",

Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.\n\nThe gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.\n\nUltimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\n\nCreated by Giant Sparrow, the team behind the first-person painting game The Unfinished Swan.",

Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!\n\nIn the course of each case, you\u2019ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn\u2019t shout \u201cOBJECTION!\u201d when you know you\u2019ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution\u2019s claims and prove your client\u2019s innocence.\n\nThe game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!",

        "description": "Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features:\n\u2022\tThe player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\n\u2022\tYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon. \n\n\u2022\tLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\n\u2022\tExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony\u2019s two planets didn\u2019t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon. \n",

        "intro": "Descend into the depths of an alien underwater world filled with wonder and peril.",
        "description": "Subnautica is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean planet. A massive, open world full of wonder and peril awaits you!\n\nDive Into a Vast Underwater World\n\nYou have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to go is down. Subnautica's oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs, and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much of it harmful.\n\nScavenge, Craft, and Survive\n\nAfter crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources from the ocean around you. Craft knives, lights, diving gear, and personal water craft. Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft more advanced items.\n\nConstruct Underwater Habitats\n\nBuild bases on the sea floor. Choose layouts and components, and manage hull-integrity as depth and pressure increase. Use your base to store resources, park vehicles, and replenish oxygen supplies as you explore the vast ocean.\n\nUnravel the Mystery\n\nWhat happened to this planet? Signs abound that something is not right. What caused you to crash? What is infecting the sea life? Who built the mysterious structures scattered around the ocean? Can you find a way to make it off the planet alive?\n\nDisrupt the Food Chain\n\nThe ocean teems with life: Use the ecosystem to help you. Lure and distract a threatening creature with a fresh fish, or simply swim as fast as you can to avoid gnashing jaws of roaming predators.\n\nHandle the Pressure\n\nBuild a Pressure Re-Active Waterproof Nanosuit, or PRAWN Suit, and explore extreme depth and heat. Modify the suit with mining drills, torpedo launchers, propulsion cannons, grappling hooks and more.\n\nFear the Night\n\nAs the sun goes down, the predators come out. The ocean is unforgiving of those caught unprepared in the darkness. Areas that are safe to explore during the day become treacherous at night, but also reveal a beauty that those who hide from the darkness will never see.\n\nDive Below the Ocean Floor\n\nCave systems wind below the sea bed, from dark claustrophobic passages to caverns lit by bio-luminescent life and burning-hot lava flows. Explore the world below the ocean floor, but watch your oxygen levels, and take care to avoid the threats lurking in the darkness.",

        "description": "Below Zero is an underwater adventure game set on an alien ocean world. It is a new chapter in the Subnautica universe, and is developed by Unknown Worlds.\n\nReturn to planet 4546B\n\nSubmerge yourself in an all-new, sub-zero expedition in an arctic region of Planet 4546B. Arriving with little more than your wits and some survival equipment, you set out to investigate what happened to your sister...\n\nUncover the Truth\n\nAlterra left in a hurry after a mysterious incident. Abandoned research stations dot the region. What happened to the scientists who lived and worked here? Logs, items, and databanks scattered among the debris paint a new picture of the incident. With limited resources, you must improvise to survive on your own.\n\nDiscover Uncharted Biomes\n\nSwim beneath the blue-lit, arching expanses of Twisty Bridges. Become mesmerized by the glittering, mammoth crystals of the Crystal Caverns. Clamber up snow covered peaks and venture into the icy caves of Glacial Basin. Maneuver between erupting Thermal Vents to discover ancient alien artifacts. Below Zero presents entirely new environments for you to survive, study, and explore.\n\nConstruct Habitats and Vehicles\n\nSurvive the harsh climate by constructing extensive habitats, scavenging for resources, and crafting equipment. Blast across the snowy tundra on a Snowfox hoverbike. Cruise through enchanting and perilous biomes in your modular Seatruck.\n\nResearch Alien Lifeforms\n\nSomething undiscovered lurks around every corner. Swim through the giant Titan Holefish, encounter the haunting Shadow Leviathan, and visit the adorable Pengwings. Keep your wits about you. Not all creatures in this strange world are friendly.\n\nSurvive the Chilly Temperatures\n\nJump in, the water\u2019s warm. The below zero temperatures of this arctic region pose a new threat. New weather conditions blanket above-ground habitats. Craft a toasty cold suit, sip on piping hot coffee, and warm up next to Thermal Lilies to stave off the chill. \n\nAn ocean of intrigue\n\nWhat really happened to your sister? Who were the aliens who came here before? Why were they on this planet? Can we find solace from grief in truth? Below Zero extends the story of the Subnautica universe, diving deep into the mystery introduced in the original game.",

        "description": "The Council oversees the elam families, aristocrats who are descended from the first humans in Rilfanor, and the banlits, who were originally people born without magical abilities. The Guild has never admitted banlits because of their lack of magical capacity; and they've never admitted women because they believed women were too weak-minded to control such power.\n\nNow, many generations later, the elam magic is weakening, and latent magic talent has reappeared among the banlit population. Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.\n\nIn your quest you'll explore randomly generated dungeons, collect treasures, master magic, avoid traps, solve puzzles, and of course cleanse the dungeons of all the evil minions within. Every dungeon is unique, no two locations will ever be the same.\n\nIt's not all dungeon-crawl. Feel at home in your very own Wizard Tower where you can enhance and customize the way you play by building a thriving town, brewing your own reagents, crafting or buying your own gear, powering up your magic, and recruiting help.",

        "intro": "Bullet Hell Insanity + Tower Defense Strategy. A quirky new type of rogue-like shooter. Blast your way through diverse planets. Play solo or online!",
        "description": "A New Kind of Roguelite Shooter. It's time to bring roguelites to the next level! Rogue Star Rescue is a unique mix of bullet hell roguelite and tower defense games. We've added strong strategy elements to the all-out insanity of bullet hell shooters. The action is smooth, the gameplay is challenging, the story is complex and nonlinear. It's a game you'll get sucked into and will end up spending months exploring the multiple intricacies and outcomes. Keeping the game fun well past the 50-hour mark is our core design focus.\n\nOnline Co-op! Games like this are better with friends. Connect with our community online to explore the RSR galaxy with two  people simultaneously! You won't find this feature in the other popular roguelite shooters. Progress with your friends and unlock the secrets of the galaxy as a team. Along with exclusive multiplayer content, there will always be something new to discover.\n\nCouch Co-op! Having a friend over? Team up with them the old fashioned way! Share a screen and blast your way through the RSR universe. Max. 2 players. No internet connection required.\n\nFight with your Team! You won't be able to stop the Rogue Star alone. Rescue your teammates along the way and they'll fight beside you against the evil aliens. Even in single-player mode, your quest is interactive and full of hilarious dialogue, not just another lonely solo-mission.\n\nThe Rogue Star. A massive Rogue Star has formed from the cosmos and is on a direct collision path with us! It threatens to vaporize everything. Leaders from planets around the galaxy have assembled a top team of fighters to stop the Rogue Star at all costs. Choose your own non-linear path through the galaxy and explore each of the 10+ planets carefully.\n\nYour Choices, Your Ending. Choose which planets to travel to and make important decisions that decide the fate of the galaxy! Depending on the path you take, there are dozens of different outcomes. The Rogue Star can destroy the entire galaxy, be reflected to the enemy's galaxy, swallowed by a black hole, sent far away through a galactic wormhole, and dozens of other hilarious possibilities in between. It's really up to you to make the right decisions based on the outcome you want to see, and who you want to rescue.\n\nTraps and Defense. While exploring each planet you must gather traps and resources to face an epic mini-boss and his waves of minions at the end of each level. Strategically placed traps slow, block, push, spike, burn, freeze, and shoot at enemies. Traps can be upgraded to make themselves stronger. Managing trap inventory and usage intelligently is critical to your success in the game, especially during the later levels.\n\nHeroes. Choose from one of the elite team members with a unique set of special abilities, each with a personal drive to save their home planet from annihilation. Unlock new players by achieving specific outcomes.\n\nLevel Up! Unlike traditional roguelikes, we've added a persistent leveling up system. With each level you earn attribute points that can improve strength, speed, health, traps, and luck. The more you fight, the more experience points you earn, the stronger you get. Build your player wisely.\n\nGuns and Items. Discover and unlock hundreds of unique items! We're thrilled to present a wide variety of guns from advanced space weaponry, to historical weapons, and everything in between. On top of carrying your main gun, you'll have an arsenal of powerful grenades ready at the tap of a button. You'll also be accompanied by upgradeable buddies, each with their own unique fighting abilities (Did you know there are dragons in space?).\n\nThree modes of difficulty. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned dungeon explorer, we've got you covered! Choose Wimpy, Normal, or Insane mode to challenge your skills and to keep the fun going. Note for the avid bullet-hell gamers: even the developers have a hard time beating the game on Insane mode ;)\n\nTime is ticking, can you stop this galactic doomsday?",

        "description": "Death Crown is a minimalist real time strategy game in a 1bit style, where you will be play Death herself, commanding her legions of death, and punishing humanity's Kingdom for its overconfidence.\n\nThe Story:\n\nAt the end of the millennial war, when all the cemeteries were overcrowded with the bodies of the dead, came the one who was called The King. Thanks to his unyielding will, The King managed to subdue and unite all the lands. The Kingdom appeared, and the era of the Human began. The King ruled wisely and fairly, but his time on this land ran out: Death came after him. But the will of The King was so strong that he could deny Death.\n\nHe grew so proud that he humiliated Death itself. The idea of the overwhelming power and immortality didn't leave his mind. The King realized that power over the living was not enough for him.\nThe King decided to get the powerful artefact known as the Death Crown. Thus begins the War of the Death Crown.\n\n\nKey features:\n\n-Clear strategic gameplay. Clear strategic gameplay. Everything is very simple: you only have barracks producing troops, mines producing gold, and towers protecting your buildings. Every building is integral to your success!\n\n-Local multiplayer. Punishing pitiful humans in co-op with a friend is much more fun! And after that you can find out which one of you is cooler in the PVP mode.\n\n-A memorable visual style. Seriously, how many strategy games in 1bit do you know?\n\n-Unique story. Upgrade your troops, march through your foe's lands, sowing death and destruction, behold the fall of the Humanity's Kingdom in the breathtaking campaign.",

        "description": "An intense, arcade-style, 'bullet hell' SHMUP/STG in which you must master a vast array of ridiculous weaponry in order to defeat a race of evil aliens who are intent on abducting innocent civilians and turning them into mutants. Jetboard Joust blends the spirit and intensity of 1980s arcade coin-op SMHUPs with the replayability and tactical elements of hardcore modern roguelikes. Don't expect a story. Do expect frantic, fluid, fast-paced 60fps action, big guns, and explosions!\n\nThe Jetboard: Leap from your jetboard like a boss to gain temporary invincibility and smash your enemies to smithereens. Destroy pretty much everything in your path. You rock.\n\nThe Enemies: Over fifty different enemies to outwit. Be prepared for them to come at you with all the game's weapons plus their own special attacks. Watch out for a few tributes to classic arcade games of the past too\u2026\n\nThe Weapons: From the conventional to the ridiculous! Jetboard Joust offers over thirty powerful weapons, each with its own distinct advantages and upgrade path, to aid you on your mission and leave a path of total destruction in your wake. Get up close and dish out massive damage with the shotgun, wreak havoc with the cluster bomb, fry enemies to a crisp with the flame tornado or shock them into submission with the lightning bolt. You'll get a different selection of weapons with each playthrough and you'll need to master them all!\n\nThe Bosses: Defeat huge bosses in a series of grueling multi-stage battles and then steal their attacks for your own use. Rendered in exquisite pixel-art detail, these guys will test your weapon-handling and evasive maneuvering to their limits.\n\nThe Planets: Choose your own path through a multitude of battlegrounds across the surface of five different planets. Discover hidden treasure, upgrades and awesome new weapons. Adapt your route based on your playstyle, the weapons you unlock and the treasure you discover. Plunder cash from fallen enemies and use it to pimp up your jetboard, jetsuit and max out your weapons for a formidable arsenal. Are you up to the challenge?\n",

One of Pigeons is infected, your job is to give this infection to another Pigeon by pecking somebody (like tag game). But look! Your points are decreasing! When your points counter hits 0, you are being caged to the end of match. Last free pigeon wins!\n\nPigeon Kingess\n\nHave you ever seen a Pigeon with bread on it's neck? This mode is exactly about it! Your target at the start of a game is to wear a crown by pecking it, then when you have the crown you HAVE TO RUN because other pigeons can take it off from you and wear it. You gain points by holding the crown!\n\nCapture The Bread\n\n2 teams with up to 4 pigeons each!\nMain task:\n- Steal bread crown from enemies base!\n- Bring it to yours\n- ???\n- Profit!\n\nPoop Point\nLike in Capture The Bread, there are 2 teams again. This time your team has to poop a given point. Team which will poop the point most will get a point!\nObviously team with max points amount wins!\n\nMovie Editor\n\nSandbox mode! You can set your pigeons, set scenery and do stuff!\nPlay animations, change styles and do your own theater!\n\nMany locations to fight!\nYou can defecate and slip on pigeons poop.\nSmart AI that behaves like stupid pigeons (very smart behaving like dumb).",

Well... now you have a chance!\n\nGrab your weapon, call out your battle drones and start clicking the car into oblivion! Earn cash, upgrade your equipment and find more vehicles to destroy!\n\nTons of upgrades, support weapons, special abilities and explosions! Taste the destruction at it's best in this clicker game.\n\nWe put much effort into graphical detail and design to bring you a high quality product. Alley in the night, construction site or gas station are some of the beautiful stages we have cooked up for you.\n\nTry to destroy different types of cars - from a Van through american Truck to a massive Bulldozer. Break the window, smash the hood, blow the tires and in the end blast them with a rocket launcher.\n\nOur main goal was to create a unique clicker experience - in both graphics and gameplay. You will see cool destruction mechanics, nice visual effects, car paint that gets more and more scratched. But what brings even more fun - is buying those high level support weapons.\n\nIf that's not enough - use stage hazards like explosive barrels or call upon your battle drones to destroy the cars faster and earn even more gold!\n\nYou will love those tools of destruction.

Only one person can wield C.A.R.D.S to take control of Protego\u2019s scattered spy crews and save the world.\n\nYou.\n\nGuided by Protego\u2019s only remaining analyst, Jim Ratio (Greg Miller), you must master the unique powers of each crew in a game of tactical Solitaire like none you\u2019ve ever played before. Guide your crews home in a tale of intrigue where nobody can be trusted. Keep your cool in a world of AI spies and cyber-enhanced operators.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve taken back control of Protego, play infinitely via Skirmish, or test your skills against the clock in Countdown, a survival mode that will test your grasp of the game\u2019s surprising tactical depths. For a new challenge every day take part in the Daily Hotspot leaderboards!\n\nKey Features:\n* Five modes and counting makes this the biggest Bithell Short yet! Campaign tells a tightly packed story and introduces the game\u2019s mechanics. For an added challenge, take on Campaign Plus instead, with its turn limits and locked tables requiring optimal tactics. The popular Countdown mode tests your endurance with wave after wave of unique decks. Skirmish gives you an infinite playground to enjoy unlocked crews. And, finally, the Daily Hotspot tosses crews into a new bite-size challenge every day.\n* Beautiful original character artwork and atmospheric design put you at the heart of your own cyberpunk conspiracy.\n* No heightened game of Solitaire would be complete without full FMV cutscenes, featuring Greg Miller and Inel Tomlinson in an original story from the team behind Thomas Was Alone, Volume, Subsurface Circular and John Wick Hex.\n* The Return of The Merry and Atlantis Project add new cards, new music and new FMV cutscenes featuring Samantha B\u00e9art and Alanah Pearce.\n* The soundtrack for your adventures is provided by the incomparable Jon Everist.",

As Redgi, heir to the Rat Throne, you must restore your broken Kingdom by banishing the merciless Frog Clan and their ferocious leader, Greenwart.\nAs you explore the deceivingly charming world, you\u2019ll encounter a cast of unique companions, ready to aid you in your adventure. And you\u2019ll need all the help you can get, whether that\u2019s new meal recipes, blueprints to forge deadly weapons and armour, or even a land-chugging, armour-plated mole mobile!\nOvercome your fears. Rescue your brothers. Restore Your Kingdom.\nYour tail has begun\u2026\n\nMaster Brutal Combat\nFrom frog zombies to gargantuan grubs - and everything in-between - the Kingdom is awash with danger. To overcome each perilous encounter, you\u2019ll need to study your opponent\u2019s attacks and react accordingly! Thankfully, there\u2019s a range of deadly abilities at your disposal, including parry bashes and fatal executions, not to mention ranged attacks with your nifty bow and arrow.\n\nExplore a Treacherous Kingdom\nFully accompanied by the deep, raspy narrations of Doug Cockle (voice of Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher), prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the mediaeval-fantasy Rat Kingdom.

Heavy armour may provide better protection but can you really afford to slow down your dodge-roll? And then there\u2019s the question of weapon; axes pack a punch, while spears are quick and nimble. Perhaps you\u2019d prefer the all-round performance of a trusty broadsword?\n\nOvercome Savage Boss Fights\nWhile danger lurks around every toadstool, you\u2019ll need to keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper when it comes to the devastating boss fights. Cold-blooded in every sense of the word, these oversized amphibians each present their own unique combat challenge, and you\u2019ll need more than a good set of armour to come out on top.\n\nBrew Recipes, Craft Weapons, Forge Armour\nRedgi\u2019s keep is also home to his brothers, Rem-Rem, Bam-Bam and Dug. Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you\u2019ll uncover\u2026 if you look hard enough. And then there\u2019s Dug, who\u2019ll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom.\n\nFeatures:\nMaster brutal combat, inspired by the souls-like genre, featuring dodge-rolls, parry bashes, and fatal executions!\nExplore a vast and treacherous Kingdom, comprising six distinct biomes, each with its own hidden paths and secrets\nImmerse yourself in the compelling story, narrated by the deep, raspy Doug Cockle (voice of Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher)\nCustomise your attack style with a vast array of distinct weapons and armour\nAssemble a band of brave companions, ready to aid you on select missions\nComplete side quests to earn additional gold-on-the-side\nUnearth special blueprints to forge new and powerful weapons\nCollect rare ingredients to cook up health-boosting feasts\nOvercome savage boss fights against the Frog Clan\u2019s deadly, oversized generals\nLose yourself in the gorgeous and lovingly-crafted 2D hand-drawn art style.",

        "description": "Last Stop is a single-player third-person adventure set in present day London.  \n\nWritten and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters. \n\n- Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. \n\n- John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. \n\n- Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. \n\nLast Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising stars Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith and Kassian Akhtar as Dylan Hughes. \n\nLast Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. \n\nRoleplay as 3 unique characters. Make choices to shape their conversations. Walk in their shoes and discover where their individual stories lead. ",

Thanks to visa limitations, Ao is forced to return to Japan, leaving Bo in England. Disillusioned by post-educational life and shoved aside by a government who doesn\u2019t want them there, both are trying to come to terms with their uncertain futures. And deep under their South London flat, something grows...\n\nAs they pack their belongings in the home they've shared, they'll unleash more than just memories\n\nWander through an intimate flat and examine the everyday belongings of Bo and Ao. Have BBQs, play video games, and stay up late just talking in bed. Follow the day to day activities and conversations of two queer, non-binary students and their friends. Get to know Lu, the multi-eyed, animal-like new flatmate.\na semi-autobiographical game\n\nNo Longer Home was born when the developers were similarly forced apart after university, and decided to stay in touch by working on a game together. Development duo Hana and Cel chose this project as a way to explore and express the emotions that came with saying goodbye.",

Manage their daily life and help them overcome their difficulties to create their best day ever.\n\nEXPERIENCE 4 RICH STORIES\nIn Waters City, the picture is not all bright. Emma, Jordan, Paul and Jenny won't say otherwise: they face many injustices on a daily basis and need your help to face these trials. Get to know them and achieve their goals by making good decisions with them.\n\nYOUR CHOICES HAVE A REAL IMPACT\nEach story has multiple endings. It is YOUR decisions that will change the events experienced by the characters and trace their path to their best day ever. And what if these seemingly independent stories were finally linked together?\n\nENDEARING CHARACTERS\n\u2022 Emma Nadger: Manager in the food company KraKer, Emma provides quality work and doesn't count her hours. However, she regularly receives sexist remarks from some of her peers and can no longer stand it.\n\u2022 Jordan Neal: Jordan is a key player in the Waters University basketball team. The team has qualified for the big university tournament, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the team members. His partner feels this is the perfect opportunity for Jordan to finally introduce him to his teammates.\n\u2022 Jenny: As a student at the prestigious Waters University, Jenny has always had good grades. However, a few weeks before her midterms, she can no longer focus on her studies and is anxious about getting to class.\n\u2022 Paul Hitik: Paul is one of the 5 candidates in the Waters mayoral election. He is aware that his city is the place of many injustices and intends to defend his candidacy to change things on a large scale.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR RELATIVES\nWith dozens of side characters, Best Day Ever deepens many relationships of friendship, love and rivalry. To stay in touch with Emma, Jordan, Jenny and Paul's friends, the phone is your best ally. You can send and receive calls, messages or keep an eye on important appointments.",

However, since 2000, various non-governmental terrorist groups have been formed. In 2030, the ISS, the largest terrorist organization united all terrorist groups around the world and started to dominate cities. The ISS has become the most threatening terrorist organization in the world. At that time, new energy source was discovered that could change the future of humankind. The United Nations and NASA have sent a research team to investigate the new energy source. The ISS knew the value of the new energy source, terrorized major cities and occupied the energy source. From that time on, unexplained incidents such as network shutdowns, infectious diseases, mysterious deaths and mysterious aircraft crashes began to occur all over the world. The United Nations has concluded that these incidents are related to newly discovered energy source. The United Nations has formed Counter Recon Special Force with competent veterans to stop terrorism. The mission of the Counter Recon Special Force is to rescue researchers detained in each city and retrieve the energy source occupied by the ISS.",

Take the role of Ella, the Actress and through exploring an old theatre try to unveil secrets hidden in the extraordinary, magical plays created in the imagination of Mr. Chardish.\n\nNOSTALGIC JOURNEY TO THE PAST\nWhen they were young, the Actress and the Director were full of dreams and ambitions. Decades later, the Actress returns to the theatre, to once more become the performer, the audience and the muse.\n\nThe performances, the letters and the radio interviews - they are all meaningful, but will the Actress find what she's looking for? Attend the last show of a famous artist reflecting on his defining moments and your role in his life.\n\nVARIETY IN ARTSTYLE AND GAMEPLAY\nWith each play you will explore a new, incredible scenography, fully painted in VR. Each performance tells the story of different characters, with individual gameplay mechanics and a unique closure. Be a robot escaping a factory or a little, boastful musketeer - every role you take is a medium for emotional experiences of the Director.\n\nGRAPHICS MADE WITH VR TECHNOLOGIES\nTo separate the performances from the real world and put the stress on their artistic nature, we decided to reach for new, creative methods of graphic design. The plays\u2019 segments of the game are painted using virtual reality technology. Exchanging traditional 3D modeling for painterly strokes and splatters granted us more expressive freedom in shaping the artistic vision of the Director.\n",

        "description": "Sunblaze is a brain-twisting precision platformer with hundreds of challenging, handcrafted levels to keep you dying for hours and hours.\n\n\u201dWhose blood is that on the walls?\u201d -Josie\n\nJosie is up for a challenge. Her dad, a retired superhero, has fixed his superhero training simulator and lets Josie go in there to play around a bit. After all, show us a parent who wouldn't want to train their daughter to be a superhero? But then suddenly the training room goes rogue, and... Josie is up for a challenge.\n\nIn this tough, hand-crafted precision platformer, you\u2019ll play as Josie, aka. Sunblaze, with a mission to complete your superhero training. The training room is full of puzzles, brain-tickling challenges, obstacles, TNT, spikes, drones... And a purrfect sidekick: the cat. You have got a cat. What else do you need?\n\nWell, skills. That\u2019s what you need. The ever-changing training room keeps on bringing you challenge after challenge, and you'll stay glued up on your controller for hours.\n\nBeing a parent is hard, but most likely not this hard\n\nOk, all the parents who have not lost their kids in a mall or other crowd ever, raise your hands? It's all good, at least you didn't lose them in a hostile superhero simulator full of lasers, evil bots, spikes, and... Well, go and see for yourself!\n\nWARNING: Playing Sunblaze may cause massive brain growth\n\nYou know, to survive all the levels, your brain needs to do some work. We know, we know, it might sound scary, but like Aristotle said: \"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.\", and Quentin Tarantino put it even better: \"Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.\"\n\nOh, are you still reading? Go and get playing right now! We will promise you one thing: dying over 5000 times on one game has never felt this good.\n\n(P.S. Dying is 100% optional, the already easy controls and gameplay can be customized with accessibility features to meet your own needs and wants.)",

Movement or firing uses up fuel though levels can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not apply to starting from the highest level reached).\n\nAvoid the moving doors and increasingly fiendish enemies, find the switches for the doors that block your way.\n\nWhen a life is lost the player is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.\n\nDon't touch anything - that would be fatal!\n\nBe careful though, loosing a life resets the current level and loosing the last life ends the game.",

        "description": "Navigate the player to the landing pad through increasingly difficult levels within the time limit and with enough fuel. Movement or firing uses up fuel, though levels can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not apply to starting from the highest level reached).\n\nAvoid obstacles or lift them out of the way with the tractor beam. Avoid the obstacles and enemy fire while navigating the terrain. Don't land too fast...make sure it's a soft landing.\n\nWhen all the humanoids are collected, fly high above the planet to escape, making sure you have enough fuel. Keep an eye on fuel levels and destroy fuel dumps to replenish.\n\nWhen all levels are complete, they repeat with a slightly higher difficulty setting.\n\nWhen a life is lost the player is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.\n\nIn Terra Lander II your ship has been upgraded with a force field. Therefore, you have a limited amount on health, but not much so be carfefull!\n\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Retro arcade game.\n\u2022 Vibrant Colours.\n\u2022 Loads of customisations available within the settings menu.\n\u2022 Endless replayability.",

Your path will consist of difficult choices and everyone will have an influence on the outcome.\n\u2026and perhaps you might be able to solve the mystery of this universe.\n\nFLYING AMONG THE STARS\n\nYou are the commander of the \u201cMelistar\u201d (\u201cThe Star Bee\u201d), and you have a swarm of intelligent anthropomorphic bees. Your ship is your home, and your mission is to keep an eye on its fighting ability to repel enemy attacks; to stay on course, and to effectively collect resources to ensure that both the Queen and soldier bees have enough food; and, of course, to keep an eye on the status of your crew, whose members strive to get into trouble or arrange it.\n\nOTHER SPECIES\n\nThe ship travels through an amazing universe full of strange insectoid races. Who you\u2019ll be forming an alliance with, and who you\u2019ll be fighting with, is largely up to you! The Merchant Guild fights the League of Smugglers; the intelligent Ants compete with Locusts for space colonies; the sinister cult of Blood Suckers spreads across the galaxy...\nWe\u2019ll have to fight and trade \u2013 and every one of these decisions can be a turning point in the story.\n\nSURVIVAL AND STORYTELLING\n\n* You can try your hand at surviving. Space cycles alternate, resources run out \u2013 and the crew increases; but luck and accurate calculation are on your side! Competently upgrade your ship and set the right course \u2013 and you can stay alive for a certain amount of time, or maybe even break a record!\n* If you like branching plots and world exploration \u2013 boldly immerse yourself in the storyline. The CyberHive universe is a mysterious and deep setting. Collect ancient artifacts and pieces of knowledge on distant planets about the past \u2013 and discover how the world turned out to be and what misfortune it faces. Maybe you can avert it... or not.\n\nMANY EVENTS\n\nAs you try to find resources and survive, you will experience many events on the ship: from intrigues within the crew and problems with passengers, to a large contraband \u201cset-up\u201d or a collision with the ghost of a legendary pirate starship. Some events form a story, and some occur randomly. But the choices within each event will also have to be considered...\n\n...Subjects with the waist of a wasp and a deadly sting; predatory rivals and faction battles; exploring the farthest corners of the galaxy; dangerous challenges and responsible decisions.\nWelcome to the world of CyberHive!\nCommander, we are counting on you.",

Negotiate your passage with local leaders, healers and warriors, or find yourself embroiled in a battle against nanite swarms, enormous scorpions and rocket-equipped robots.\nFrom thriving villages to crumbling cities, petrified forests and bone-dry ocean beds, this strange new world holds a multitude of terrains to uncover, beautifully rendered in 2D isometric art. Explore, solve puzzles and be prepared to face many tough choices that will shape this land long after you complete your journey.\n \nUNFORGETTABLE FACES\n\nHumanity as you know it has been totally reforged, and that is most evident by the characters in BEAUTIFUL DESOLATION. Technology and mortality have become blurred. Sentient religious robots run rife. Trans-humanistic tribes and leaders have emerged to claim power, and ruthless hunter mercenaries roam the plains. All have adapted to this powerful unknown, and are often at odds with each other. Meet and interact with over forty unique characters, each fully voiced by African voice actors, with thousands of lines of dialogue and multiple conversation paths. Additionally, full CGI cutscenes are scattered throughout the story to bring you even closer to the enthralling sci-fi world and its characters,\n\nMASTERFUL MUSIC SCORE\n\nBEAUTIFUL DESOLATION features a vibrant and highly experimental soundtrack by none other than Mick Gordon.\n \nREVAMPED FOR CONSOLE CONTROLLERS\n\nBEAUTIFUL DESOLATION's controls, UI and movement have been fully redone to work intuitively on console controllers.\n",

With looming war, rooted corruption, economic crisis and reform needed, the choices fall on your shoulders. How will you lead?\n\nYOU ARE THE PRESIDENT\nAs President Anton Rayne, lead Sordland during your first term. Navigate a political drama, driven by conversations with your cabinet members and other significant figures in a country with its own complicated history. With looming border conflicts, entrenched corruption, economic crisis and people desperate for reform, as leader the difficult choices fall on your shoulders as you strive to uphold your election promises.\n\nA COUNTRY IN TURMOIL\nIn 1954, the country of Sordland is emerging from a 20-year dictatorship, following a bloody civil war. You play as a charismatic young man, Anton Rayne, who has surprised everyone by rising to the top of the party in power and getting elected as the new President of Sordland.\n\nThe people are hungry for democratic reforms after decades under a traditionalist power. The economy is in shambles and the political landscape is shifting. Neighboring superpowers are watching closely, and there are military threats on the horizon.\n\nAs President, you have the final say but every choice you make has an impact. Your colleagues, the opposition, corporations; everyone has a point of view. Think and act carefully: once enacted your choices can not be reversed.\nGood luck, Mr. President.\n\nWHO WILL YOU TRUST?\nWork closely with the Cabinet and prominent figures to forge strong policies and practices. You will need to keep your allies on your side and carefully consider where you will compromise your values and who you will make an enemy of. Everyone has their own ambitions in play.\n\nWHAT WILL YOU SACRIFICE?\nLeading a country is demanding. Face constant conflict about which is more important, serving the country or supporting your family. Is it possible to be a good father and a good president at the same time?\n\nHOW WILL YOU LEAD?\nWeighty, dramatic conversations: Navigate intricate conversations in this 400K-word branching political drama.\nEvery choice has consequences: Make difficult choices on security, economy, diplomacy and more. Even outside the office, your values and beliefs will be challenged.\nMake allies and enemies: Interact with a wide array of characters with different personalities and ideologies.\nThe oath of office versus family and values: See the real impact of the choices made in office on your family and close relationships\nPay attention to current events: Follow the situation in Sordland through reports and news.\nWhat will your legacy be?: You can take the country in many different directions, resulting in one of 9 different major endings.\nEvery decision you make is final: there is an autosave feature that does not allow loading earlier saves. Make choices carefully.",

        "description": "In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. \n\nThe game is divided into maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life.\n\nRenovate and decorate train stations and trains.\nDetailed and complex 3D models of railway stations allow you to renovate them - from cleaning, painting and to replacing decorations and mechanical elements.\n\nBuild your own station.\nThanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.\n\nChoose how hard you want to work.\nThe level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment. The game can be very demanding if you decide to complete each stage one hundred percent but it also can be perfect for beginners if you just want to relax while renovating and simply have a good time. In such a case, you only need to complete half the planned tasks to advance to the next stage.\n",

        "intro": "Explore a world inhabited by robots and solve the mystery of a lost civilization",
        "description": "Only one city remains on the planet, and it\u2019s only robots who inhabit it now. Protected by a glass dome, Endeavor rises above the once lively area and worker robots are trying their best to keep it going. In order to maintain it, every robot has to do its job perfectly and any imperfections found are being discarded.\n\nThrown to a junkyard for a malfunction, a single robot worker is on a quest to get itself fixed. But the city sees this loyal worker as a threat now, so all the robots and defenses that protect Endeavor have turned against their former colleague. With the unique ability to control various machines of the city, including any robots that are in the way, this little Robot is on a mission to fix himself and find intelligent life.\n\nYet it seems that there is no intelligent life left. Only the robots programmed to keep the city nice and clean for people who are nowhere to be found.\n\n\nKey Features\n\nYou are on your own\nLong ago humans vanished leaving behind only their robotic creations. Now the world they left behind is falling apart. Is there anyone out there to help you fix it and discover what happened to the people who used to live here?\n\nYour enemies are your tools\nAlone in the world, the little robot has a special trick up his sleeve: the ability to hack and gain control of any other machines. Use them as you like: you can make them fight each other, explore unreachable places, solve puzzles, or just accompany you in your journey. There are dozens of robots with different abilities for you to explore.\n\nEnjoy hand-drawn visuals\nThe art style of Retro Machina is based on illustrations from the science fiction books of the twentieth century. Set in the retro-futuristic universe, the game is inspired by the work of such legendary people as Jacque Fresco, one of the most famous futurists in the world.\n\nExplore the multifaceted world\nFrom underground facilities to the golden streets of Endeavour, the last city on the planet, your journey will take you across a whole region filled with new challenges, new robots, and mysteries to explore.\n",

Choose a variety of outfits and coordinate tops and bottoms. Some are based around Pok\u00e9mon motifs and others change your hairstyle.

Until one day, Bo goes missing!\n\nYou play as Ayo, your not-so-average clown, in search of his best friend and beloved dog who has mysteriously disappeared. What happened to Bo? Will they ever juggle together at the park again? Or set up that circus act they\u2019ve always planned? You\u2019ll find out along this incredible adventure as you strive to reunite clown and dog.

Each stage has a unique theme and interesting platforms to ensure gaming is fun and not repetitive because Ayo is not the kind of clown to make the same old jokes over and over again. His jokes get better each time.\nHuge Bosses and loads of enemies- Take on bosses bigger than life itself and prove that clowns are much tougher than they seem. Don\u2019t be fooled by Ayo\u2019s sweet demeanor!\nWeapons - Tanks, helicopters, dinosaurs, toy hammers, balloon swords, water balloons, you name it. They can help uncover hidden places, extinguish fire, defeat enemies, prank your friends...etc.\nSkills- Head stomps, wall jumps, slope slides, and many more, Ayo sure has a lot of tricks up his sleeve.\nSide Quests- There\u2019s plenty of side quests you can take on in Town or along your journey, so be prepared for some surprising rewards.\nCollectibles- Can you find and collect all the hidden items throughout the game?

        "description": "The Peace of Rosantica is Threatened Once Again\n\nThe peaceful and beautiful island of Rosantica is under threat once more by a relentless evil. The magical barrier between Rosantica and The Scourge has started to crack, allowing dangerous creatures to slowly seep back in to try and take over the island. Flynn stumbles upon this invasion and discovers he must stand up against The Scourge to stop its spread into Rosantica. Accompanied by his mythical companion Dex, Guardian Spirit of the Land, Flynn will be challenged by the evil from The Scourge and its powerful overlord.\n\nClassic 2D Action Platformer\n\nFlynn: Son of Crimson is a handcrafted 2D action platformer that will take you on a journey of discovery and conflict as you learn to master the art of Crimson Energy. Help Flynn and Dex save Rosantica before the evil from The Scourge claims his home.\n\nFlynn and Dex\n\nSummon your mythical companion and protector Dex in times of need and fight alongside her as you work to save Rosantica. Dex will excel in crushing tough walls and slashing/biting her way through hordes of enemies. She\u2019s the best doggo a boy like Flynn could hope for!\n\nThe bond between Flynn and Dex is one of friendship, mutual protection and love for one another. With the imminent threat coming from The Scourge, Flynn and Dex charge snout-first into battle.\n\nExplore Rosantica and The Scourge World \n\nExplore Rosantica and its unique regions, each filled with ancient mysteries to be discovered. Collect relics along your journey and uncover new paths as you fight your way to victory. \n\nThe Scourge is a dark world, filled with hate, trying to infest and destroy the beauty of Rosantica. You will need to enter this sinister world to take on Zealock, Lord of this dimension, and his mysterious dagger wielding warrior, Rozia. \n\nEmbrace the Power of Crimson Energy \n\nFlynn discovers he has powers he never knew about from a lineage that is a mystery. Discover the power of Crimson Energy and help Flynn to master this new part of him.\n\nThe Crimson Blade, a staple in Flynn\u2019s arsenal, is the first weapon of Crimson energy gifted to Flynn by the Goddess Sorrell during a great time of need. Unlock piercing dashes and uppercuts to destroy those nasty foes.\n\nThe Crimson Axe demands precise timing and enemy prediction, trading the quick cuts of the crimson blade for a weighty windup. Use the axe to crush your enemy\u2019s shields, and smash brittle walls to access new areas with brute force.\n\nThe Crimson Claws are a swift and energetic set of weapons used to stagger enemies with high attack speed and air superiority. Unleash your inner wildcat with unique wall jumping and spiral drill attacks to tear into enemies at a rapid pace.\n\nBecome a True Master of the Elements\n\nElemental Magic in the form of fire, ice, and lightning will be unlocked through a natural mutation with the flora of Rosantica.",

I\u2019ve received the cd you had sent me and after a cursory glance at the files, I have to say the chances of recovering the software seem promising. There seems to be some data corruption but it\u2019s quite possible it may still run.\n\nNow, again, I haven\u2019t really dug too deep into it but it appears that it\u2019s some sort of a simple game. I\u2019ve seen plenty of things labelled as \u201cmap\u201d so it probably has many levels. Pretty sure it involves some sort of a gun also? My guess is, it\u2019s most likely one of those retro shooters.\n\nAnyway, gonna go take a nap. Couldn\u2019t really get much sleep last night; had a lot of nightmares, can\u2019t quite remember about what. I\u2019ll keep you updated on my progress.\n\nSincere regards,\nDavid",

Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 2,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!\n\nRevolver and Co features 105 story levels across 7 unique worlds and 12 question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of each mission.\n\nOr if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long session where the only thing you have to lose is time.",

The title screen\u2019s main menu acts as a respawn hub, cursors may appear as enemies or helpful guides, graphical errors obscure parts of the screen and the player\u2019s character explodes into pixels upon death.\n\nTo survive, you\u2019ll have to quickly identify which portions of the screen can be reached, which pixels can be touched and which ones are simply background art. Adapt as gameplay suddenly shifts to a different perspective or requires interaction with a glitched object to proceed. At its core, Paradox Error is an ever-changing environmental puzzle where you\u2019re expected to die repeatedly and use those failures to inform further attempts, until the goal is eventually within reach. Decidedly hardcore in difficulty but fair enough to encourage repeated play, this is an exercise in trial-and-error, where determination becomes its own reward.\n\nFeatures:\n\n\u2022 Explore a glitched and unpredictable digital world!\n\u2022 Adapt to shifts in gameplay mechanics and perspective.\n\u2022 Try, die and repeat to learn how to survive.\n\u2022 Enjoy a minimalistic black-and-white pixel art style.\n\u2022 Use UI elements and game-breaking bugs to your advantage!",

As you master its logic, Induction will rewire how you think about cause and effect.\n\nAcross more than 50 meticulously designed puzzles, you must explore the counter-intuitive possibilities time travel permits. You will learn to choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.\n\nEach puzzle is crafted to reveal a unique aspect of the game\u2019s elegant yet exacting internal logic, gently guiding you into realising the potential of your powers. Induction does not pander, but gives you the satisfaction of mastering an imaginary yet honest set of physical laws.\n\nAccompanying Induction\u2019s minimalist visuals is a rich and responsive ambient soundtrack by Melbourne-based electronic composer and radio broadcaster Tim Shiel.",

Some of those goddesses even went on to become idols.\nHowever, there were others who simply refused to follow the rules.

Soon enough it is revealed that she's the Aragami who had been causing frequent power outages in one small-town area of Tokyo. Sho decides to protect his beloved hometown by helping the goddess to get rehabilitated!\n\n\"Rehabilitate the goddess!\"\n\nWait...aren't goddesses supposed to help humans?\n\nWith the setting moving from Akihabara to a quiet small-town area of Tokyo, the story of one naughty goddess's rehabilitation begins now!",

        "description": "The Magnificent Trufflepigs is a first-person, metal-detecting narrative game designed to be played in a single evening. You play as Adam, a sharp-witted but compassionate man returning to his childhood village of Stanning. There he'll help a woman named Beth on her mission to unearth a local treasure. As cracks begin to appear in Beth\u2019s fairy tale plan for everything, you\u2019ll delve into her history and discover all may not be as it seems. And you\u2019ll have to choose how Adam responds to Beth as she faces her demons.\n\nGameplay combines laid-back metal detecting and exploration with a strong interpersonal narrative, all set in a beautiful English countryside. The Magnificent Trufflepigs is a game about trying to find something, and the tone it sets is like a typical English summer: mostly pleasant, but with stormy moments that threaten to ruin everything.",

        "intro": "Fates of Ort is a retro fantasy RPG focused on strategic action, in a land where time is frozen when you stand still. Cast powerful spells - but beware, they will cost you your life. ",
        "description": "Magic is powerful, but it is not free. Every spell you cast requires a little bit of your life energy to spark it. Cast enough spells and you will extinguish your very soul. This means you need to be strategic when fighting, balancing the cost of magic with the risk of taking damage from your enemies.\n\nHow each spell manifests in the world depends on what divine power you choose to combine it with. For example, the Evoke Force spell will cause the ground to erupt with a series of sharp ice crystals, summon a thunderous lightning strike, or barrage the ground with a meteor shower \u2013 all depending on what the spell is combined with.\n\nUse the magic spells at your disposal to defeat the demons spilling out from the underworld. In Ort, time is frozen whenever you stand still. This means you have the opportunity to plan your attacks and be strategic.\n\nLike any RPG, you will be slaying enemies to collect loot and experience. The items you pick up will improve your magical abilities, though some come with curses... As you level up, you will learn additional magic spells to use against your enemies.\n\nOrt is varied and expansive, an open world for you to explore. Choose the order of the quests you pursue, or just explore to meet new characters. The final battle is available whenever you choose, but... Are you strong enough?\n\nPlay as a novice mage, forced to take on the responsibility of saving the world and those that are important to you. Quests can be completed to gain access to new areas, save and unlock allies, gain items and powers, and more. Replays are encouraged because small decisions can have permanent and significant consequences, leading to different game outcomes.",

Your job is simple: protect their dungeons!\n\nFeatures\n\nJoin the Dungeons Company and climb the corporate ladder\nCrush so-called \"heroes\" and protect the company's treasures\nHire monsters, manage your employees and your stock of traps\nDeal with employee strikes and other fun events\n\nRogueDefender\n\nEach run will be different but players will keep some of their Master's bonuses between runs. Like we've already mentioned, our game is a mix between Roguelite and Dungeon Management. How did we achieve that? By running many tests to find the perfect balance between management and dungeon phases!\n\nDungeon Phase\n\nFirst, you will have to plan your defense against a group of adventurers. Check their stats and resistances, then place the best traps and monsters to defeat them! When you think your dungeon is ready, let the crawl begin! \n\nYou will then be able to watch those heroes die! It's a reversed dungeon crawler: heroes will move through your dungeon and will trigger the traps you placed. When a group of adventurers encounters a group of monsters you positioned in your dungeon, a turn-based fight will happen!\n",

        "description": "Kids can learn how to make their own games with guided lessons created by Nintendo. From a simple game of tag to a run-and-jump obstacle course, each lesson is broken down into multiple, manageable segments that let kids go at their own pace\u2014and have fun in the process.\n\nLearn the basics of visual game programming \n\nBy playing through interactive lessons, kids will learn the basics of visual game programming. Nodon, colorful creatures with distinct personalities, keep kids engaged through lessons with tips and motivating messages. With a simple press of a button, swap between the programming screen and the game screen\u2014watch how programming changes the game on the fly.\n\nTrack progress and build confidence\n\nAfter completing each lesson and building a game, kids will test their knowledge by completing Checkpoints\u2014small puzzles or tasks to solve with programming. Master these skills and head to Free Programming mode to let your imagination (and programming chops) run wild.\n\nThe Nodon you meet each have distinct personalities that complement their functions. Have fun connecting them together to see how they interact and bring your game to life. The in-game Nodopedia lets you quickly check what each Nodon does as you create. There\u2019s also a guide that recaps important skills! Easily swap between the Programming and Game screens to see the hard-working Nodon in action.\n\nTake advantage of the Nintendo Switch system\u2019s many features. Instead of the control stick, program motion controls to control your game. Want to create some competition? Add in a multiplayer function and pass a Joy-Con\u2122 controller to a friend. It\u2019s up to you (and your Nodon friends) to decide what type of game you want to make.\n\nLooking for inspiration? Exchange codes and download* games from friends. You can even go into Free Programming mode to look at those downloaded games\u2019 programming and put your own twist on it. Upload your own creations and share them with other Game Builder Garage players*. Learn programming, build games, and share with friends!",

Will the crises ever end!?\n\nMerrily Perilly plays like a top down adventure game where you must resolve the perpetual perils that afflict Perry by interacting with the townsfolk and environment. Through exploration and experimentation, the nonlinear narrative branches and intersects into many paths leading to several distinct endings.\n\nFeatures:\n-Fast-paced Gameplay\n-6 different Endings\n-Non-linear Exploration & Narrative\n-Hats!

        "description": "Urban Wasteland Adventure Golf\nThe rich fled to Mars but venture back to a desolate Earth for a round of golf. Each hole in the wasteland offers its own little story and possible puzzle to sink the perfect shot. Play through destroyed brutalist monuments, crumbling shopping malls, and abandoned museums as neon signs and poignant graffiti take swings at current events, Silicon Valley culture and humanity. \n\nThree Stories Make a (W)hole\nPiece together the full story of how humanity fell through three distinct sources - Details from the lone golfer\u2019s story, who's come back to Earth for one last game. The Radio Nostalgia from Mars broadcast gives a glimpse into the lives of those who escaped, and the narration of  a \u201csecret spectator\u201d watching from a distance.\n\nThe 1% Killed the Radio Star\nBe accompanied by a purposefully composed soundtrack as well as personal stories broadcasted on Radio Nostalgia From Mars. The station caters to citizens of Mars, nostalgic for Earth as they listen to music from the 2020s, and dial in to share their memories of the planet. A smooth voiced radio DJ keeps the show flowing with updates and announcements hinting to a not so glamorous life on Mars.\n\nFits Like a Glove\nThree distinct modes mean every golfer can find something for their tastes. Casual players can focus just on the story and a relaxing scenic round of golf in Story Mode. Those looking for an extra challenge can beat each hole under par using skill and puzzle solving through Challenge Mode. While the total pros can try Iron Mode, where there\u2019s almost zero room for error. Easy to grasp controls and a minimalist UI underpin the whole game so anyone can easily pick up and play at their own pace. \n\nThat's a Keeper\nIncluded with every copy of the game is the digital Golf Club Wasteland Official Soundtrack plus a Graphic Novel Art Book that further expands the back story of the lone golfer Charley in stunning visual format.\n",

A lot of bugs!\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nSo, you\u2019re a guy in a wingsuit, who really likes to fly in his wingsuit, do crazy stunts, earn money, spend it on more wingsuit flying gadgets, get trophies, that kind of boring stuff.\nRight?\n\nWRONG!\nCow Catcher is an unusual wingsuit flight simulator.\nYou become Strange Wingsuit Man, whose goal in life is to fly around, steal random cows and wave his hands like a madman while he\u2019s at it.\nYou might want to think of it as a hobby\u2026\nSTEAL SOME AMAZING COWS\n\nYou\u2019re job is to kidnap some amazing cows by attaching a rope to them and then transporting them to your pen.\nBeware though, for the flight is dark and full of\u2026 ok, that\u2019s not the story, we beg your pardon.\nHave you ever handled a cow, high up in the air?\nNo? Well, that\u2019s a shame, but we\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s done.\nYou have to be very careful not to steer your cow in any of the obstacles awaiting you during your flight.\nI mean, why would you want to go hitting a cow against\u2026things?\nThat would be crazy.\nKeep in mind, that typical cows usually wriggle during rope-secured flights.\nWe know that kind of stuff, duh.\nEARN COWCOINS\nFor every kidnapped cow you will be earning cowcoins, obviously. When you\u2019ve earned enough of the marvellous currency, it\u2019s time to go shopping! Sure, you can buy some reasonable gear, which will enhance your flying (why would you do that?) or you can exchange your money for a crazy beak, which will match your mad flapping (highly recommended)!\nWhat else will you find in the virtual store?\nYou will have to play to find out!",

        "description": "Skittles is a game of skill in which the goal is to score exactly fifty points by knocking down pins numbered 1 through 12 with a throw of a wooden stick.\n\nThis Skittle game can be played solo against the computer or in local multiplayer.\n \nThe player throws a stick into the pins. The player's score depends on the number of pins knocked down:\n\nIf he knocks down a pin, he scores the value of the pin;\nIf he knocks down several pins, he scores the number of pins knocked down (if all the pins knock down, the player scores twelve points);\nIf a pin is not completely down on the ground and is balanced on another pin or on the the throwing stick, it is not counted.\nFallen pins are then raised on their feet, numbered facing the throwing area, right where they are and without lifting them off the ground. Thus the configuration of the playing area changes. Each player takes a turn at throwing and as many turns are taken as necessary.\n\nThe winner is the one who scores exactly 50 points. If this mark is exceeded, the player or team score drops to 25.\n\nSo as the 50 points are approached, the player must be careful to knock down only the pin(s) that will cause the player to reach the 50 points by value (if only one pin falls) or number (if more than one pin falls). For example, if his score is 48, the player must knock down any two pins or the number 2 pin and only that one pin. If the score is 49, the only solution is to knock down the number 1 pin and no other pins.\n\nThe first player or team to reach 50 points wins the game.\n\nMain features:\n-Full 3D\n-AAA Graphic Engine\n-AAA Physic Engine\n-6 skittle sets with different physical parameters\n-4 Sceneries\n-From one to 4 players",

Your weapon is a magical wooden staff that brave Theofil uses to destroy his enemies. His abilities will help you fight against dangerous enemies.\n\nThe action takes place somewhere in ancient Egypt, full of mysterious temples and caves, which are protected by deadly traps. Access to them is defended by powerful opponents who will not give up without a fight. Stone golems throwing boulders at you and goblins wanting to stab you with a spear. You'll find it all in Theofil!\n\nWatch out for sharp spikes popping out of the ground, fire-breathing ancient statues with images of deities, and flying, poisonous blades. Avoid them to prevent your health bar from dropping to zero. Your dexterity will be the key to discovering the secrets of the ancient world, as their guardians protect access to them. They are cunning and attack you in a group, so keep your eyes around the head!\n\nIn addition to traps and enemies, you will solve puzzles that require cleverness and logical thinking. Move big statues and switch levers to open gates. Jump on platforms to reach the hidden treasures of the ancient world.\n\nTravel through the winding corridors of mysterious temples, bristling with traps appearing on each wall and find a hiding place with a powerful boss. Defeat him to get new items and grow in strength with Theofil! Will you manage to go through the dangerous journey and discover the secrets of the ancient world? Enter the mysterious world of Theofil and follow the path with him! ",

        "description": "Demons of Asteborg\u00ae is an original and challenging new 2D game, mixing action, small puzzles and strategy. This 16-bit game will bring back many memories for retro fans.\nThe story\n\nLong ago in the Kingdom of Asteborg, a war broke out, pitting humans and demons against each other in a bloody battle. Sagramor, a powerful mercenary, and Maria, a sorceress with fighting magic, joined forces to defeat the demonic army.\nSagramor found a way to lock the demons in an alternate dimension, at the cost of his own life. His sacrifice earned him the title of \"Legend of Asteborg\".\n\nShortly before the end of the war, Maria gave birth to a child named Gareth.\nShe died 4 years later.\n\nGareth was then taken in by the royal orphanage, and Bohort, the leader of the armed troops, saw in him an invaluable potential. He trained him from an early age to become a formidable warrior.\n\nDecades later, Zadimus, the former leader of the Demons, who survived the great war, found a way to reopen the portal to the parallel dimension in order to free his fellow Demons and declare war on the humans in order to take back the Kingdom of Asteborg.\n\nAs Gareth, now the royal guard of Asteborg, you will go on an adventure, braving the lands of the kingdom and its dangerous lands populated by bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nAlong the way, you'll learn more and more about the ancient war and your identity.\nBut beware, Zadimus won't let you get away with it...",

        "intro": "Hindsight 20/20 is an action RPG with morality decisions from BioWare and Sucker Punch veterans. Discover the power of your morality with choices/actions that truly matter.",
        "description": "Hindsight 20/20 - Wrath of the Raakshasa is a 3D third-person action RPG where players can fix mistakes from past playthroughs and relive them for vastly different gameplay and story experiences. Discover the power of morality in each journey where choices and actions have meaningful consequences. \n\nHindsight 20/20 is founded on five pillars:\n\n1. Choice in Combat: \nDecide the fate of two kingdoms as one-armed warrior Jehan. Will he choose to respect the values of his former home by respecting life in all forms? Or will he choose the path of conflict and violence? Before every battle, make the conscious decision to wield a non-lethal stun rod to pacify enemies or a ruthless sword to put them down for good. \n\n2. A Malleable World: \nChampaner and its inhabitants switch between several states of disdain or acceptance for Jehan. Each playthrough shows only one version of the world as both the town and its inhabitants experience the effects of Jehan\u2019s choices and actions.\n\n3. Interesting AI and Bosses: \nAll NPCs react to the world Jehan shapes. Dialogue options and weapon choice are only two factors in how the AI behaves. Hindsight 20/20\u2019s bosses exhibit emotion, making them more relatable. Nuances in their personality come to light as Jehan continues on his journey. The line between good and evil blurs as they react to Jehan. \n\n4. The Experience Engine: \nThe Experience Engine is a hand-crafted, in-house gameplay engine driven by player choice. This engine is solely responsible for creating the dynamic gameplay and story experiences Jehan witnesses. Every action and choice made is observed and recorded by the Experience Engine leading to a high level of replayability. This feedback loop of choices, actions, and reactions affect the flow of the story and drives the gameplay of Hindsight 20/20.\n\n5. Ten different endings:\nHindsight 20/20 has 10 different endings and four of those endings have absolutely no overlap. Each ending is carefully tailored to the choices and actions made in that journey.",

        "description": "Calling all Superstars! Mario Party\u2122 is back with 5 classic boards from the Nintendo 64 Mario Party games. Frosting meets flowers as you race to get the most stars (and sabotage your opponents) on the Peach\u2019s Birthday Cake board from the original Mario Party game. Or watch the countdown that unleashes Bowser Coin Beam and hold onto those coins on the Space Land board. The tides can turn quickly in Mario Party, so stay vigilant, partygoers. This and all other modes can be played online*, too!\n\n100 classic minigames return from the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube\u2122 games and more!\n\nTry your hand at a Superstar collection of minigames from throughout the Mario Party series. Whether you are saving up coins for stars in board game mode or practicing in free play, there is nothing quite like being the last one standing in Mushroom Mix-Up or Shy Guy Says. All minigames are played with button controls, so you can stick to the Joy-Con\u2122 controller or bust out the Nintendo Switch\u2122 Pro Controller or a Nintendo Switch Lite system.\n\nParty with superstars near or far\n\nBring the party anytime, anywhere with same-system**, local wireless**, or online* play. Matches with friends in board game mode save each turn, so feel free to take a break and pick up where you left off. Use stickers to praise or pester fellow players as you race across the board collecting stars. All modes support online multiplayer, so you can hop in with friends for a few minigames or a marathon 30-turn match. Victory is just as sweet (and stealing stars is just as satisfying) from anywhere across the globe.",

This remake features two campaigns that cover the events of Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising!\n\nFight alongside capable Commanding Officers\n\nDefend your land with the help of Andy, Max, Sami, and other Commanding Officers, each with their own specialties and CO Powers. Andy can repair units, while Sami can boost the abilities of troops. Your opponents can use CO abilities of their own too! Throughout both campaigns, the COs you meet play a critical role both on the battlefield and in the story.\n\nRecruit some friends and see who the superior strategist is\n\nWhen you aren\u2019t busy keeping the peace in one of the two campaign stories, flex your army-commanding chops in Versus Mode*. Up to four players can battle on dozens of maps. Each player chooses a CO from either campaign and can strategically use their CO Powers to turn the tides of battle. Customize your combat with options like funds per allied base and fog of war.\n",

        "description": "Thea 2: The Shattering is a follow-up to the successful Thea: The Awakening, which brings the idea of innovative genre hybrid, with elements of turn-based, 4X strategy, survival, RPG and a card game, to entirely new and thoroughly polished level.\n\nThe player takes on the role of a deity from the Slavic mythology-inspired pantheon and as such, controls the fate of a small flock of believers struggling for survival. This goal can be achieved in many ways, from diplomacy to war, from exploring to conquering, but any playstyle will surely lead to completely unique adventures thanks to the procedurally generated environments. Rich options, from crafting to town-building system, as well as the co-op multiplayer gameplay, make Thea 2 an ideal choice for tactically minded players, who are up for a challenge.",

        "description": "Ultra Age is a high-speed, sword-swinging action game set in the far future that follows the story of young warrior Age, who embarks on a mission to save humankind from extinction. Use your blades to cut through robotic and mutant foes, explore futuristic locales, and unravel a vast conspiracy concerning the fate of the planet.\n\nFar in the future, the resources of Earth have become insufficient, its ecosystem long ago changed irrevocably by a passing meteor. Humankind has divided into two: the people who have escaped Earth and relocated to the space colony, 'Orbital Arc,' and the others who have remained on Earth in a facility called \u2018The Shelter.\u2019 \n\nHumanity vanished from Earth after civilians from The Shelter failed an experiment that was meant to be the last hope for humanity, while people from Orbital Arc sent expeditions to Earth in search of resources. Failing to find any signs of life, a young sword-wielding warrior named \u2018Age\u2019 falls down from orbit to Earth. Accompanied by his floating android, Helvis, he must find the indispensable key to the survival of humankind.\n\n-Unleash Combos with Blade-Changing Action-\nSlash through foes with a variety of blades in high-speed, stylish action! Change blades on the fly with powerful moves to create linkage and run devastating combos. Different attributes and varied actions call for unique strategy against different types of foes.\n\n-Narrow Gaps Using the Wire-\nLaunch the wire skill to pull smaller enemies toward you, or Quantum Warp to get instant access to larger foes! Use the wire to strategically overcome numerical inferiority, traverse gaps on land and quickly grab items.\n\n-Get the Edge with Skills-\nGather elements to enhance your blades, expand your skills, and learn new combos. Install modules and power gear to level up Age and increase your arsenal of blades to take down the toughest of enemies. Use Helvis to burst into Critical Rage, cast Healing Pocket to recover, or Time Shift to loot more items.\n\n-Experience a Post-Apocalyptic Earth-\nFollow Age on his journey in the year 3174. Experience cutscenes that tell the story of Age\u2019s mission across futuristic mecha, forests and deserts developed with Unreal Engine. Encounter mysterious characters and overcome menacing bosses to uncover the story behind the fate of humankind.",

Battle through the most ridiculously hazardous corners of the galaxy and use your surroundings to your advantage. Outmaneuver your frenemies and shatter them into colorful bits. \n\n\nARENAS\nBattle around the galaxy in fifteen arenas, with new ones coming. Classic asteroids, icy comets, mythical monsters, curious contraption, it is all there for you to chart a route before the match. Each arena puts you in perils, which you can turn into opportunities and use to your advantage \n\nSHIPS\nAll the ships in Have a Blast are small and nimble, enabling you to navigate the busy arenas. Each of the five ships has a unique powerful ability, requiring a slightly different approach. But even the strongest attacks can be countered, and it is never too late to turn the tide of battle to your side. \n\nGAME MODES\nDeathmatch \u2013 Last pilot standing wins the round in this familiar mode. Be the first to win five rounds and you win the match. \n\nTeam match \u2013 Any combination of players is possible in a team vs team play. Great opportunity to reinforce some friendships and ruin others. \n\nMothership \u2013 Keep your mothership safe and it will provide you with health, ammo and some refuge. Lose your mothership and you\u2019ll be toast very soon. \n\nChallenges - Try every ship and every environment by completing specific challenges against the computer. \n\n\nBOTS\nAdd bots to any match. Driven by a capable AI, they can provide some challenge when friends are not around; or you can use them to add energy to matches. If the adaptive AI gets frustrating or too easy, you can always adjust the challenge from the menu. \n\n\nWE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR RETRO-INSPIRED MODERN-DESIGNED ARCADE!",

        "description": "Magnus Failure is an isometric exploration and adventure game with logical elements. The protagonist of the game is a person who, for unknown reasons, finds himself in the isolation of other people and scans the radio in search of a signal. The appearance of a seemingly incomprehensible message makes you want to find the sender. So you set off on a journey through the unique world of Magnus Failure! Solve puzzles using the right combination of items, find them in the surrounding world and solve mini-logic games. The world is full of mechanisms that open up new locations for the player.\n\nMagnus Failure is an atmospheric journey through the mysterious world of signs, symbols and clues that make up the plot of the game. What surrounds the player is ambiguous. He can freely interpret what happened to the world and why the hero was left alone. The unique graphic aesthetics of the game deepens the overwhelming impression of being in a different reality. The protagonist himself is quite an unusual character because he wears a huge helmet with an attached mask straight from the Japanese kabuki theatre. The game is no shortage of other similar references and symbols that give it its character.\n\nMagnus Failure has ambitions to deepen the player's willingness to ask himself philosophical questions about who he is and what his place in the world is. Will you try to find answers to these questions and plunge into the mysterious world of Magnus Failure? Will you open up to the unknown and find the sender of the signal?",

        "description": "Residual... a new breed of survival platformer from OrangePixel and legendary indie publisher Apogee Entertainment.\n\nIn a forgotten galaxy full of strange planets, a lone explorer crash-lands on one with an ancient alien secret. Venture forth from the shipwreck across a harsh, unpredictable, procedurally generated world. Harvest food and make campfires to stay alive. Craft science-fiction survival tools like teleporters and mining devices. Unearth alien technology capable of repairing the ship. Hunger, cosmic storms, hostile plant life and the mysterious ooze are among the many obstacles you'll face.\n\nYou won't be alone! PDB (a snarky floating Personal Disaster Bot) will follow and assist you along the way. Sometimes. PDB also helps you discover the hidden lore, revealing the history of the planet as you explore deeper and deeper, assuming you can survive!\n\nOrangePixel\u2019s uniquely designed Nature Engine generates 1000's of planets from a vast set of environment-based rules, then drops explorers on a world brimming with potential. If a planet orbits close to the sun, intense heat, high winds, and sparse vegetation will pose a set of challenges wildly different from other worlds. Further from the sun, long nights make stamina easier to maintain, but reduced solar power turns every suit function\u2014like scanning the planet\u2014into a critical decision.\n\nResidual welcomes players to a non-violent survival experience with limitless possibilities and no traditional combat. Jump and descend through colorful, highly detailed pixel art evoking classic 2D platformers. Solve light puzzles to reveal secrets of a long-lost civilization. Select a male, female, or non-binary protagonist, customize survival parameters like how fast time advances, and race to repair the ship, dig up ancient secrets, or collect data entries on hundreds of undiscovered objects.",

Find the scrolls of Harten and Aesthirya to unearth legendary episodes from the history of a great empire.\n- Beware of cunning and deadly traps in the labyrinths!\n- Experiment with the wonders of the Magic Forge: make powerful potions, enchant your equipment, and craft epic  legendary items and relics!\n- When the moons align, experience adventures in the grim labyrinth of the Arcane Dungeons, questing for marvelous treasures!\n\nI believe we don't have to say farewell to the gems of classic dungeon crawlers and role-playing games - even in our hectic modern world - and with Moonshades I am trying my best to deliver their spirit and charm, while bringing them up-to-date. I'm a great fan of role-playing games like the Eye of the Beholder, Might & Magic, Wizardry, and Dungeon Master, and these great classic RPGs kindled my creative spark for this personal fantasy challenge: Moonshades.\n\nBeing the long-held dream of an indie developer, Moonshades is constantly shaping and growing with the aim of reviving the excitement of those memorable RPGs. I have a myriad of ideas for quests, puzzles, and various adventures for this old-school RPG that I would love to share with you. I'm keen to avoid the common mistake of focusing only on my favourite aspects and so potentially miss the goal of creating something great along the way! As such, I'm always open to your views and ideas!\n\nSo, step into the teleport, and have fun in this adventure game!\n\nThe game currently includes 30 hand crafted dungeons and the procedurally generated Pits. New levels will be added in the form of free patches.",

In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon - and there\u2019s something for everyone.

Both of these civilizations come into play in the new \u201cPath to Nirvana\u201d scenario, where you compete to have the most followers of your religion on a unique Southeast Asia map. \n\nIncludes the Khmer civilization with Jayavarman VII, the Domrey unique unit, and the Prasat unique improvement.\n\n\u2022 Civ Unique Ability: The \u201cGrand Barays\u201d ability gives Khmer additional food when Farms are built next to Aqueducts, and Aqueducts provide both Faith and an Amenity. \n\n\u2022 Leader Unique Ability: Jayavarman\u2019s \u201cMonasteries of the King\u201d ability lets Khmer grab adjacent territory as well as Food and Housing when Holy Sites are built on a river. \n\n\u2022 Unique Unit: The Domrey, a ballista mounted on an elephant, is stronger than a Catapult, can move and shoot on the same turn, and exerts Zone of Control. \n\n\u2022 Unique Building: The Prasat replaces the Temple and provides a Relic Great Work slot. Missionaries that are produced here gain a new attribute when killed in religious combat: they generate a Relic.\n\nAlso includes the Indonesian civilization with Dyah Gitarja, the Jong unique unit, and the Kampung unique improvement:\n\n\u2022 Civ Unique Ability: With the \u201cGreat Nusantara\u201d ability, Coastal Tiles provide Indonesia with minor adjacency bonuses for certain districts and Entertainment Complexes give an extra Amenity if they are adjacent to a non-lake Coastal Tile.\n\n\u2022 Leader Unique Ability: Gitarja has the \u201cExalted Goddess of the Three Worlds\u201d ability, granting bonus Faith to coastal cities and allowing her to purchase Naval units with Faith at a discount, as well as eliminating movement cost for Religious unit to embark or disembark.\n\n\u2022 Unique Unit: Indonesia\u2019s unique unit is the Jong, which replaces the Frigate. It is faster, gains extra combat power if it\u2019s in a formation, and all of the units in its formation gain its movement speed. \n\n\u2022 Unique Improvement: The Kampung provides Housing, Production and Food for each adjacent Fishing Boat, and can be improved through further tech research later in the game. \n\nNew \u201cPath to Nirvana\u201d Scenario:\n\u2022 The lands around the Indian Ocean flourish with many religions and many people. Heaven has chosen you to bring the light to all these lands. Is your faith up to the challenge? In this 50 turn scenario, compete to have the most followers of your religion, the most faith per turn, and the most foreign cities following your religion.\n\nNew Wonder:\n\u2022 Angkor Wat: The largest religious monument in the world returns to Civilization! This temple must be built adjacent to an Aqueduct and provides Faith, plus it adds Housing and a Citizen to every one of the owner\u2019s cities when built.\n\nNew Natural Wonder:\n\u2022 Ha Long Bay: This breathtaking bay was designated one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2012, and provides Food, Production, and Culture, in addition to providing a large combat bonus to naval units in its tiles.\n\nNew Map:\n\u2022 Spread your empire through Southeast Asia in this new map, with a True Start and random location option.",

Joining Kevin and the Onion King are 4 new chefs that are right at home in the woodland kitchens; Scout Chef, Bear Chef, Beaver Chef and the bespectacled Owl Chef.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to chop wood to keep the fires burning as you fry up a hearty breakfast, or toast tasty S\u2019mores across 15 new levels set amongst tree-tops and campsites. Fresh levels of co-operation will be needed for the new wearable backpacks that hold the ingredients the team of chefs need to serve the hungry campers.",

        "description": "Since we began development on Dead Cells, many years ago now, we\u2019ve been completely blown away by the amazing reaction of the community. Without your support and feedback we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today. Rise of the Giant is our way of saying thank you. Here\u2019s a free DLC with a bunch of new content, mostly aimed at the people who have been hanging around since day 1, it\u2019s high level and should offer more challenge than most sane people would think reasonable.\n\nFeatures:\nNew levels: You\u2019ve got a new level that\u2019s connected to the main level structure and immediately available to anyone who\u2019s finished the game at least once. You\u2019ve got another (poorly) hidden level, for the masochists who know that there is a Boss Cell 5\nNew Bosses: Mirroring the above, you\u2019ve got a new completely different type of boss available in the main level structure, with another INSANELY difficult boss hidden behind even more ridiculously difficult content.\nNew content: There are 10 new enemies, 13 new weapons/skills and a bunch of other upgrades to core game systems. There are additions to the story/lore of the game, new secrets, new blueprints and\u2026\nSkins: People have been requesting this for ages and we\u2019ve finally found the time to make the necessary changes to accommodate the request. You\u2019ve now got access to female skins, fluo skins and a Christmas tree skin, cos why the hell not.\n\nOn top of these major changes we\u2019re continuously trying to update the game in ways that make it more challenging and more just, all the while remaining open to new players. As such you will notice that the difficulty has been rebalanced so that the entry level of the game, while extremely challenging is now in line with the 5 extra difficulty levels available to those who like to suffer.\n\nWe hope that you like Rise of the Giant and would like to remind you that we\u2019re not done, we\u2019ll be continuing to make content for the game for as long as you keep demanding it, so feel free to let us know what you\u2019d like to see and if we can make any changes that would make you happy.",

        "intro": "Build Your Greatest Empire on Nintendo Switch\u2122",
        "description": "Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization VI Expansion Bundle, which combines both Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, takes the turn-based strategy classic to new heights. With 16 new civilizations, 18 new leaders, and major enhancements to gameplay such as Great Ages and an active planet where geology and climatology present unique new challenges, the pursuit of building the greatest empire becomes as exciting as it has ever been in the Civilization franchise.\n\nThe Civilization VI Expansion Bundle contains all features from the Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, that includes: \n\n\u2022NEW LEADERS AND CIVS: Combined together, sixteen new civilizations and eighteen new leaders are introduced. Each brings unique bonuses and gameplay, as well as unique units, districts, wonders, buildings, and more. \n\n\u2022GREAT AGES: As your civilization ebbs and flows and you reach milestone Historic Moments, you will move towards Dark Ages or Golden Ages, each providing specific challenges or bonuses based on your actions in game. Rise triumphantly from a Dark Age, and your next Golden Age will be even stronger \u2013 a Heroic Age.\n\n\u2022LOYALTY: Cities now have individual Loyalty to your leadership \u2013 let it fall too low, and face the consequences of low yields, revolts, and the potential to lose your city if it declares its own independence. But one civilization\u2019s loss can be your gain as you inspire Loyalty among cities throughout the map and further expand your borders.\n\n\u2022GOVERNORS: Recruit, appoint, and upgrade powerful characters with unique specialization bonuses and promotion trees to customize your cities, and reinforce Loyalty.\n\n\u2022ENHANCED ALLIANCES: An enhanced alliances system allows players to form different types of alliances and build bonuses over time.\n\n\u2022EMERGENCIES: When a civilization grows too powerful, other civilizations can join a pact against the threatening civilization, and earn rewards, or penalties, when the Emergency ends.\n\n\u2022TIMELINE: Review your civilization\u2019s history at any time with the new Timeline feature, a visual journey through the Historic Moments that you encountered on your path to victory. \n\n\u2022ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS: Volcanoes, storms (blizzards, sandstorms, tornados, hurricanes), climate change, floods, and droughts bring the world to life in a brand-new way. Your settlement choices are more important than ever as you balance high risks and high rewards. \n\n\u2022POWER AND CONSUMABLE RESOURCES: Strategic resources play an additional role. These resources are now consumed in power plants to generate electricity for your cities. Initially you\u2019ll be powering your most advanced buildings by burning carbon-based resources like Coal and Oil, but renewable energy sources also unlock as you progress to current-day technologies. Your choices about resource usage will directly affect the world\u2019s temperature and can cause melting ice caps and rising sea levels. \n\n\u2022ENGINEERING PROJECTS: Shape the world around your empire to overcome unfavorable land conditions by making improvements like canals, dams, tunnels and railroads. When settling cities, consider the flood risk to coastal lowland areas, but keep in mind that in the late-game, new technologies like Flood Barriers can be used to protect these tiles.\n\n\u2022WORLD CONGRESS: Make your voice heard among the other leaders of the world. Earn Diplomatic Favor through Alliances, influencing city-states, competing in World Games, and more. Use Diplomatic Favor to extract promises from other leaders, vote on Resolutions, call a Special Session to address an emergency, and increase the weight of your votes in your quest to achieve the new Diplomatic Victory. \n\n\u202221st CENTURY TECHNOLOGIES & CIVICS: A new era has been added to the Technology and Civics trees. Combat new environmental effects with speculative ideas such as relocating your population out to seasteads and developing technologies to recapture carbon emissions.",

Don\u2019t be fooled by his chillingly calm demeanor, his hard-hitting style can deal some white-hot damage. Included with Sephiroth is the Northern Cave stage and additional tracks. Yes, that song is included.\n\nSephiroth strikes fear into his opponent\u2019s heart by using a combination of heavy strikes and deadly magic. His neutral special attack, Flare, launches an exploding fireball. Hold it down long enough to pull off a devastating Gigaflare, but with shorter range. Nothing instils a sense a dread like Sephiroth\u2019s side special, Shadow Flare. This quick blast of energy surrounds your opponent and eventually explodes\u2014it can also be stacked 5 times!  In addition to these malicious maneuvers, Sephiroth can slash in any direction at high speed with his up special, Blade Dash / Octaslash, and he can create a protective barrier with his down special, Scintilla. \n \nWhen at a disadvantage, such has having more damage than his opponent, a wing can grow from Sephiroth\u2019s back. In this demonically angelic state, his power and movement speed is increased, Smash Attacks gain Super Armor, and he can even jump up to three times in the air. The greater disadvantage you\u2019re at, such as in damage, score, or stock, the easier it will be for the wing to grow. Sephiroth is at his most powerful when he uses his Final Smash, Supernova. After a wide slash, Sephiroth unleashes an incredible explosion that deals damage and sometimes status effects! With his Masamune blade in hand and destruction on his mind, Sephiroth is a force to be reckoned with.\n",

His specials tap into his Devil Gene with moves like the beam-shooting Devil Blaster and high-flying Devil Wings. The son of Tekken icon Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya has a chip on his shoulder and destructive power.\n\nWhat makes Kazuya Mishima unique in this game are his standard attacks\u2014rather than 4 directional standard attacks, he has 8. This addition of diagonal inputs mimics his abilities in the Tekken games and make him an unpredictable fighter with a lot of combo options. The stage added with this fighter is the Mishima Dojo, which starts out with all four directions closed off. A strong launch or direct attack can shatter the walls and ceilings, allowing for opponents to get KO\u2019d. \n\nTekken rated TEEN by the ESRB. \n\n",

It directly helps the animals in need - not those virtual, but the real ones. 100% of 11 bit studios and Dead Mage proceeds from Paws and Claws DLC go to the Humane Society International charity, whose main mission is to help animals all over the world.

(Pest Extermination Tool), an exciting new melee weapon that draws in enemies for close-range attacks.\n\n\u2022        Expanded character customization and lore: An increased level cap, additional perks and flaws, wholly new armor sets, and several variants for existing gear.

She is a powerful tactical combatant, able to pierce armor, break guards, and poison foes. The DLC also includes several new monsters and a new consumable item type: the Aegis Scale!\n\nThe Color of Madness DLC opens the Farmstead region which has become the site of a fallen comet!

Build & manage your own graveyard while finding shortcuts to cut costs, expand into entertainment with witch-burning festivals, and scare nearby villagers into attending church. This is a game of capitalism and doing whatever it takes to build a thriving business. \n\nFace ethical dilemmas. Do you really want to spend money on that proper hotdog meat for the festival when you have so many resources lying around? \nGather valuable resources & craft new items. Expand your Graveyard into a thriving business, go ahead and gather valuable resources scattered in the surrounding areas, and explore what this land has to offer. \nMake business alliances. These dead bodies don't need all that blood, do they? Why not sell it to someone who can put it to good use. Same for body parts. Hey, it's being efficient with recycling! \nExplore mysterious dungeons. No medieval game would be complete without these. Take a trip into the unknown and find useful new ingredients which may or may not poison a whole bunch of nearby villagers. Capitalism.",
